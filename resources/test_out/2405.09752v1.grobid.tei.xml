<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many real-world datasets are represented in the form of graphs, such as sea surface temperatures, Covid-19 cases at regional or global levels, and PM 2.5 levels in the atmosphere. Graphs play a crucial role in data science, facilitating the mathematical modeling of intricate relationships among data points. Typically composed of vertices with either undirected or directed edges, graphs regard each data point as a vertex and use edges to represent pairwise connections in terms of distances or similarities. A graph signal is a collection of values defined on the vertex set. The graph structure can be either provided by specific applications or learned from partial or complete datasets.</p><p>As an extension of (discrete) signal processing, graph signal processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.56,350.30,11.62,8.81" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has become an emerging field in data science and attracted tremendous attention due to its capability of dealing with big data with irregular and complex graph structures from various applications, such as natural language processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.03,386.16,10.58,8.81" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, traffic prediction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.20,398.12,10.58,8.81" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, climate change monitoring <ref type="bibr" coords="2,280.64,398.12,10.58,8.81" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and epidemic prediction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,397.76,398.12,10.58,8.81" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Graph signal recovery aims to recover a collection of signals with certain smoothness assumptions defined on a graph from partial and/or noisy observations. Unlike signals defined in traditional Euclidean spaces, the intricate geometry of the underlying graph domain must be considered when processing and recovering graph signals. Graph signals typically exhibit smoothness either locally or globally over the graph.</p><p>There are some challenges in graph signal recovery when exploiting the underlying graph structure to improve signal reconstruction accuracy. First, the topology of a graph desires a comprehensive representation involving many graph components, such as structural properties, connectivity patterns, vertex/edge density, and distribution. Second, it may be insufficient to describe the smoothness of graph signals by simply restricting the similarity of signal values locally. Moreover, the growth of graph size leads to a significant computational burden. To address them, various techniques have been developed, including graph-based regularization methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.91,565.49,10.79,8.81" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,167.99,565.49,7.47,8.81" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,179.77,565.49,7.47,8.81" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.53,565.49,7.19,8.81" target="#b8">9]</ref>, spectral graph theory <ref type="bibr" coords="2,298.94,565.49,15.77,8.81" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,319.01,565.49,12.45,8.81" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.77,565.49,12.45,8.81" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.52,565.49,11.83,8.81" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.92,577.44,15.77,8.81" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,181.18,577.44,11.83,8.81" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Time-Varying Graph Signal Recovery</head><p>A time-varying or spatial-temporal graph signal can be considered as a sequence of signals arranged chronologically, where each signal at a specific time instance is defined on a static or dynamically changing spatial graph.</p><p>Consider an undirected unweighted graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸), where 𝑉 is a set of 𝑛 vertices and 𝐸 is a set of edges. We assume a collection of time-varying graph signals {x 𝑡 } 𝑡=1,...,𝑚 with x 𝑡 ∈ R 𝑛 are defined on 𝑉 with a time index 𝑡. Let 𝑋 = [x 1 , . . . , x 𝑚 ] ∈ R 𝑛×𝑚 be the data set represented in matrix. The pairwise connections on the graph 𝐺 can be modeled by an adjacency matrix 𝐴, where the (𝑖, 𝑗)-th entry of 𝐴 is one if there is an edge between vertices 𝑖 and 𝑗, and zero otherwise. This binary adjacency matrix can be extended to the non-binary case for a weighted graph, where each entry indicates the similarity between two vertices. Throughout the paper, we use a standard 𝑘 nearest neighbor (kNN) approach based on the Euclidean distance of data points to construct the adjacency matrix.</p><p>Given an adjacency matrix 𝐴, we further define the graph Laplacian matrix, 𝐿 = 𝑀 − 𝐴 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑛 , where 𝑀 is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal element 𝑀 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑗 𝐴 𝑖 𝑗 . The graph Laplacian serves as a matrix representation of the graph structure and can be used to describe some important characteristics of a graph, such as node connectivity and similarity. For example, geographic locations in the form of coordinates, i.e., longitude and latitude, are typically used to calculate the pairwise distance and, thereby, the graph Laplacian for geospatial data. For some data sets without obvious graph domains, a preprocessing step of graph learning can be implemented; see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,219.10,378.19,16.60,8.81" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for a comprehensive review of graph learning techniques.</p><p>Time-varying graph signal recovery aims to recover an underlying matrix from its partially observed entries that are possibly polluted by additive noise. Mathematically, a forward model is 𝑌 = 𝐽 • 𝑋 + N , where 𝑌 is the observed data, 𝐽 ∈ {0, 1} 𝑛×𝑚 is a sampling matrix, and N is a random noise. In this work, we focus on recovering time-varying signals, represented by the matrix 𝑋, from incomplete noisy data 𝑌 defined on static spatial graphs in the sense that the vertex set and the edges do not change over time. In addition, we adopt a symmetrically normalized graph Laplacian that is pre-computed based on geographic locations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related Works</head><p>The recovery of graph signals from partial observations is an ill-posed problem due to missing data. Graph regularization plays a crucial role in developing a recovery model for time-varying signals by enforcing temporal correlation and/or describing the underlying graph topology. An intuitive approach for recovering time-varying graph signals is to apply interpolation methods to fill in the missing entries, such as natural neighborhood interpolation (NNI) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,314.72,604.34,15.27,8.81" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Numerous recovery models with diverse smoothness terms have been proposed to further preserve the underlying geometry. For example, Graph Smoothing (GS) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,329.91,628.25,16.60,8.81" target="#b17">[18]</ref> characterizes the smoothness of the signal using the graph Laplacian of 𝑋. Alternatively, temporal smoothness is incorporated in Time-Varying Graph Signal Recovery (TGSR) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,387.76,111.19,16.60,8.81" target="#b18">[19]</ref> by formulating the graph Laplacian of 𝐷 𝑋, where 𝐷 is a first-order temporal difference operator. The combination of the graph Laplacian of 𝑋 and the Tikhonov regularity of 𝐷 𝑋 was considered in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,209.95,147.06,15.27,8.81" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In contrast, the graph Laplacian of 𝐷 𝑋 with an additional low-rank regularity of 𝑋 was formulated as Low-Rank Differential Smoothness (LRDS) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,169.37,170.97,15.27,8.81" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In the Tikhonov regularization, ∥ 𝑋 𝐷 ∥ 2 𝐹 = tr(𝑋 𝐷𝐷 𝑇 𝑋 𝑇 ) implies that 𝐷𝐷 𝑇 is treated as the temporal graph Laplacian. In <ref type="bibr" coords="4,338.33,182.92,15.27,8.81" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the graph Laplacian matrix 𝐿 is replaced by (𝐿 + 𝜖 𝐼) 𝑟 , where 𝐼 is the identity matrix and 𝑟 ≥ 1 for a high-order Sobolev spatial-temporal smoothness. Its main advantage lies in faster convergence, as this approach does not necessitate extensive eigenvalue decomposition or matrix inversion. Recently, another low-rank and graph-time smoothness (LRGTS) method has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,224.64,242.70,15.27,8.81" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, where the sum of the nuclear norm and the Tikhonov regularizer on the second-order temporal smoothness is adopted to promote the low-rankness and the temporal smoothness, respectively.</p><p>All the models mentioned above can be condensed into one minimization framework:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,159.83,308.34,306.59,22.39">min 𝑋 1 2 ∥𝑌 − 𝐽 • 𝑋 ∥ 2 𝐹 + 𝛼 2 tr(𝐷 𝑇 𝜃 𝑋 𝑇 𝐿 𝑠 𝑋 𝐷 𝜃 ) + 𝛽𝑅(𝑋) + 𝛾 2 tr(𝑋 𝐿 𝑡 𝑋 𝑇 ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝐷 𝜃 is a 𝜃-th order temporal difference operator, 𝐿 𝑠 and 𝐿 𝑟 are the spatial and temporal graph Laplacian matrices, respectively, 𝑅(𝑋) is the regularization term applied to 𝑋 describing its characteristics, and 𝛼 ≥ 0, 𝛽 ≥ 0, 𝛾 ≥ 0 are three parameters. Two common choices of 𝜃 are (1) 𝜃 = 0 that corresponds to 𝐷 𝜃 = 𝐼 and (2) 𝜃 = 1 used in TGSR. Additionally, 𝐿 𝑠 can be a transformed version of the classical graph Laplacian 𝐿, e.g., L = (𝐿 + 𝜖 𝐼) 𝑟 in the Sobolev method <ref type="bibr" coords="4,134.77,412.05,15.27,8.81" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where 𝜖 &gt; 0 and 𝑟 ≥ 1, which can be non-integer. The temporal graph Laplacian can be constructed by using the 𝜏-th order temporal difference operator, i.e., 𝐿 𝑡 = 𝐷 𝜏 𝐷 𝑇 𝜏 , for which case the temporal Laplacian can be expressed via the Frobenious norm tr(𝑋 𝐷 𝜏 𝐷 𝑇 𝜏 𝑋 𝑇 ) = ∥ 𝑋 𝐷 𝜏 ∥ 2 𝐹 (see Tikhonov with 𝜏 = 1 and LRGTS with 𝜏 = 2). The regularization 𝑅(𝑋) can be chosen as the nuclear norm of 𝑋 if the underlying time-varying graph signal 𝑋 is low rank. Various models utilize different choices of 𝐷 𝜃 , 𝐿 𝑠 / L, 𝐿 𝑡 , and the regularization 𝑅. Leveraging the recent growth in deep learning, some time-varying graph signal recovery methods include unrolling technique <ref type="bibr" coords="4,214.64,507.69,15.27,8.81" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, graph neural network (GNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,354.05,507.69,15.27,8.81" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and joint sampling and reconstruction of time-varying graph signals <ref type="bibr" coords="4,314.75,519.65,15.27,8.81" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In this work, we are dedicated to developing unsupervised time-varying graph signal recovery algorithms that do not involve or rely on data training.</p><p>Following the general framework (1), we propose a novel low-rank regularization 𝑅(𝑋) based on the error function (ERF) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,302.32,567.47,16.60,8.81" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for sparse signal recovery (see Section 2.3). In addition, to handle non-Gaussian type of noise such as Laplace noise, we propose a variant model in which the Frobeinus norm based data fidelity term is replaced with the ℓ 1 -norm data fidelity (see Section 2.4). In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,411.73,603.33,3.74,8.81" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we provide a summary of the proposed models and relevant works pertaining to the general framework outlined in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,225.70,627.24,10.58,8.81" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Real Data</head><p>In the real data experiments, we first test the daily mean Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 concentration dataset from California provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data. We used the data captured daily from 93 sensors in California for the first 200 days in 2015. The constructed graph is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="15,297.77,174.95,3.74,8.81">4</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="15,335.58,174.95,3.74,8.81">5</ref>, we compare the average recovery accuracy of all the comparing methods over 50 trials when the sampling rates are 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45. In Table <ref type="table" coords="15,325.23,198.86,3.74,8.81" target="#tab_4">2</ref>, we also compare the performance of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, which shows Algorithm 2 can improve the accuracy of Algorithm 1 under some sampling rates with longer time in general. Next, we test the sea surface temperature dataset, which was captured monthly by the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL). The data set can be downloaded from the PSL website https://psl.noaa.gov/. We use a subset of 200 time points on the Pacific Ocean within 400 months. The constructed graph is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="15,162.35,571.29,3.74,8.81">6</ref>. We see from Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="15,241.20,571.29,4.98,8.81">7</ref> that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods significantly and consistently across all sampling rates. In Table <ref type="table" coords="15,390.04,583.25,3.74,8.81" target="#tab_5">3</ref>, we also compare the performance of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, which indicates Algorithm 2 can improve the accuracy of Algorithm 1 under certain sampling rates but with more computational time in general. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussions</head><p>Using the sea surface temperature data, we conduct an ablation study of the proposed model ( <ref type="formula" coords="18,165.83,350.40,3.87,8.81" target="#formula_7">5</ref>) without the smoothing regularization by setting 𝛼 = 0 or without the lowrank ERF term by setting 𝛽 = 0. We plot the RMSE curves with respect to the sampling rates and the noise levels in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="18,308.88,374.31,3.74,8.81" target="#fig_3">8</ref>, showing that the ERF regularization has a larger influence on the performance compared to the Sobolev-base graph Laplacian regularization.  Using the same sea surface temperature data, we investigate whether the proposed model ( <ref type="formula" coords="18,165.10,613.64,3.87,8.81" target="#formula_7">5</ref>) is sensitive to the parameters (𝑟, 𝜖) in defining the Sobolev-graph Laplacian and 𝜎 2 in defining the ERF regularization. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="18,324.79,625.60,4.98,8.81" target="#fig_4">9</ref> shows that the proposed approach is not sensitive to various degrees of smoothness controlled by 𝑟 and 𝜖. Although the ERF regularization plays an important role in the recovery performance, as illustrated in the ablation study, the proposed model is not sensitive to the choice 𝜎 2 as long as it is larger than 10,000.</p><p>In addition, we compare the proposed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 using the sea surface temperature data and show the results in Tables <ref type="table" coords="19,380.01,159.01,29.67,8.81" target="#tab_5">2 and 3</ref>. One can see that the two algorithms lead to similar RMSE, but Algorithm 2 is slower overall. We therefore prefer to use Algorithm 1 unless the data is heavily polluted by the non-Gaussian type of noise, such as Laplace noise.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we exploit high-order smoothness across the temporal domain and adaptive low-rankness for time-varying graph signal recovery. In particular, we propose a novel graph signal recovery model based on a hybrid graph regularization involving a general order temporal difference, together with an error-function weighted nuclear norm. We also derive an effective optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence by adopting a reweighting scheme and the ADMM framework. Numerical experiments have demonstrated their efficiency and performance in terms of accuracy. In the future, we will explore using high-order difference schemes to create a temporal Laplacian and low-rankness for recovering graph signals with dynamic graph topology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="13,134.77,273.12,331.65,7.66;13,134.77,283.26,182.03,7.49"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1The graph is constructed by kNN with 𝑘 = 5.

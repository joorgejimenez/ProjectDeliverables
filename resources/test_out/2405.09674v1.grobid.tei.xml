<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>I introduce a new family of axioms extending ZFC set theory, the Σ n -correct forcing axioms.</p><p>These assert roughly that whenever a forcing name ȧ can be forced by a poset in some forcing class Γ to have some Σ n property φ which is provably preserved by all further forcing in Γ, then ȧ reflects to some small name such that there is already in V a filter which interprets that small name so that φ holds. Σ 1 -correct forcing axioms turn out to be equivalent to classical forcing axioms, while Σ 2 -correct forcing axioms for Σ 2 -definable forcing classes are consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal (and in fact hold in the standard model of a classical forcing axiom constructed as an extension of a model with a supercompact), Σ 3correct forcing axioms are consistent relative to an extendible cardinal, and more generally Σ n -correct forcing axioms are consistent relative to a hierarchy of large cardinals generalizing supercompactness and extendibility whose supremum is the first-order version of Vopenka's Principle.</p><p>By analogy to classical forcing axioms, there is also a hierarchy of Σ n -correct bounded forcing axioms which are consistent relative to appropriate large cardinals. At the two lowest levels of this hierarchy, outright equiconsistency results are easy to obtain. Beyond these consistency results, I also study when Σ n -correct forcing axioms are preserved by forcing, how they relate to previously studied axioms and to each other, and some of their mathematical implications. iv Thank you to my advisor, Gunter Fuchs, for his guidance, kindness, and support over the past several years, and for suggesting such a fascinating research topic. Thank you also to Arthur Apter and Russell Miller for agreeing to serve on both my dissertation and oral exam committees, and to everyone in the CUNY logic community who answered a question I had or provided enlightening conversation during my time here. I would also like to thank Joel David Hamkins, who first kindled my interest in set theory over a decade ago with a talk he gave at my undergraduate institution and the dinner we attended afterwards, has continued to entertain, challenge, and inspire me during his visits to CUNY, and proved a disproportionate number of the prior results this dissertation draws upon; Corey Bacal Switzer, who welcomed me into the CUNY set theory community when I first arrived, talked to me in depth about my research after he graduated, and asked some fruitful questions; and all the friends and family who supported me during this time and endured my attempts to explain what a forcing axiom is in plain language. v</p></div>

Sections 1.2 and 1.3 cover classical forcing axioms and maximality principles respectively. Section 1.4 briefly surveys the theory of Boolean-valued models and their quotients by ultrafilters. Section 1.5 addresses the technical issue that there are multiple possible notions of the interpretation of a name by a filter, which can diverge when the filter is not generic or the 1 name is not forced to be a subset of the ground model. Finally, Section 1.6 lays out the most notable and relevant results in set-theoretic geology, the study of the forcing grounds of the universe (i.e. those inner models of which the universe is a generic extension).</p><p>Chapter 2 introduces the large cardinals which will form the hypotheses of later consistency results. Joan Bagaria has done a great deal of work on related topics, though with somewhat different motivations. This chapter is a mix of previously known results (many of them due to or first explicitly written down by <ref type="bibr" coords="9,330.64,255.01,42.13,12.46">Bagaria)</ref>, straightforward generalizations of old results, and a few genuinely new thoerems. Section 2.1 explores the basic properties of the Σ n -correct cardinals, i.e. those cardinals θ such that V θ agrees with V on the truth of Σ n formulas with parameters in V θ . Section 2.2 introduces the supercompact cardinals for C (n) , which are the critical points of supercompactness embeddings which additionally preserve arbitrarily large initial segments of the Σ n -correct cardinals. These are importantly distinct from Bagaria's C (n) -supercompact cardinals, and in fact more closely related to his notion of C (n) -extendibility. I prove some useful characterizations of supercompactness for C (n) , and show that as n increases these cardinals form a hierarchy starting from ordinary supercompactness and then extendibility, reaching upward toward Vopenka's principle. Section 2.3 covers the Σ n -correctly H λ -reflecting cardinals, a generalization of Miyamoto's H λ -reflecting cardinals, which for any fixed n form a hierarchy reaching from the regular Σ n -correct cardinals to the supercompact cardinals for C (n−1) . Chapter 3 finally begins to discuss the main topic of this dissertation. Section 3.1 defines Σ n -correct forcing axioms, motivating their statement with a characterization of classical forcing axioms due to Ronald Jensen. It goes on to prove that, for suitably iterable Σ n -definable forcing classes, the corresponding Σ n -correct forcing axiom holds in a forcing extension by a Baumgartner-style iteration of any model with a cardinal supercompact for C (n−1) . It also contains several other basic facts about the axioms. In Section 3.2, I explore several alternative statements of Σ n -correct forcing axioms, motivated by various equiva-lents or enhancements of classical forcing axioms found in the literature; these alternative formulations are more convenient than the Jensen-style version of the axioms for certain proofs. Section 3.3 addresses the natural question of whether increasing n necessarily results in a strictly stronger Σ n -correct forcing axiom for sufficiently nice forcing classes; this turns out to be surprisingly hard to answer in general. Section 3.4 briefly considers forcing axioms for classes which can collapse ω 1 ; the classical forcing axioms for such classes are of course trivially true or trivially false in most cases, but the Σ n -correct versions are potentially interesting. Section 3.5 resolves a technical ambiguity in the statement of Σ n -correct forcing axioms, specifically whether they are single sentences quantifying over all Σ n formulas encoded in the model or schemes with a separate instance for each Σ n formula in the metatheory. As it turns out, both interpretations are viable, but the consistency proof in the former case requires more care and slightly stronger hypotheses.</p><p>Chapter 4 explores the bounded version of the axioms. Asperó introduced equivalent principles, but I take a somewhat different approach, defining a notion of a filter being weakly generic over a model in order to facilitate a Jensen-style formulation of Σ n -correct bounded forcing axioms. Section 4.1 proves that these axioms are consistent relative to Σ n -correct H λ -reflecting cardinals for suitable λ ≥ κ. Conversely, Section 4.2 obtains the existence of large cardinals in L from Σ n -correct bounded forcing axioms, establishing equiconsistency results for the two lowest levels of the boundedness hierarchy.</p><p>Chapter 5 studies when Σ n -correct forcing axioms are preserved by forcing, drawing on Sean Cox's unified framework for preservation results in terms of extensions of generic elementary embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="10,193.69,613.69,11.71,12.46" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Chapter 6 explores the relationships of Σ n -correct forcing axioms to classical forcing axioms, maximality principles, and each other, with Section 6.1 addressing when different principles turn out to be equivalent and Section 6.2 containing non-implication and inconsistency proofs. Both sections conclude by listing some related problems which remain open.</p><p>Chapter 7 introduces residual reflection principles, weakenings of both Σ n -correct (bounded) forcing axioms and Σ n -correct H λ -reflection which state that if a formula whose truth is preserved by some forcing class holds of some (not too large) parameter, then that parameter reflects to a small object of which the formula also holds. The main result of the chapter is that for forcing classes with a Σ n definition which is itself preserved by all posets in the class, Σ n -correct forcing axioms (bounded or unbounded) may be factored as the conjunction of the Σ n -maximality principle for that class and an appropriate residual reflection principle.</p><p>Unfortunately, that hypothesis only holds for a small number of forcing classes.</p><p>Finally, Chapter 8 explores some of the consequences which follow from Σ n -correct forcing axioms. Section 8.1 focuses on the cardinality of the continuum. Whereas classical forcing axioms either do not settle the size of the continuum or imply that it is ℵ 2 , Σ 2 -correct forcing axioms for certain classes can also imply CH, or that the continuum is indescribably large. Section 8.2 looks at combinatorial applications, specifically the tree property, ♦, Kurepa's hypothesis, and stationary reflection. Section 8.3 touches on some implications with a large cardinal or generic large cardinal character.</p><p>The appendices contain information on basic facts which will be familiar to most but not all readers, and so is included for completeness. Appendix A analyzes the formula complexity of a number of basic set-theoretic properties, streamlining certain proofs in the main body which rely on such analysis. Appendix B compiles a number of widely but not universally known lemmas which will be used repeatedly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Forcing Axioms</head><p>The study of forcing axioms began in 1970, when Martin and Solovay, seeking a statement that would settle many of the independent questions resolved by the continuum hypothesis but would be consistent with ¬CH, introduced Martin's Axiom <ref type="bibr" coords="15,402.98,195.13,17.19,12.46" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 1.2.1. Martin's Axiom MA is the statement that if P is a forcing poset which satisfies the countable chain condition and D is a collection of dense subsets of P of size less than the continuum, then there is a D-generic filter F ⊆ P (i.e. for all D ∈ D, D ∩ F is nonempty).</p><p>Martin and Solovay noted allowing P to be arbitrary leads to inconsistency when P can collapse ω 1 , and that the ccc "is not the weakest restriction on P which will prevent cardinal collapse, but it has the virtue of being strong enough to permit the proof of" the consistency of MA with the continuum being any regular uncountable cardinal.</p><p>In the following decades, set theorists studied forcing axioms for a much broader range of forcing classes:</p><p>Definition 1.2.2. If κ &gt; ω 1 is a cardinal and Γ is a forcing class, the forcing axiom F A &lt;κ (Γ)</p><p>is the statement that for any P ∈ Γ and any collection D of dense subsets of P with |D| &lt; κ, there is a D-generic filter F ⊆ P.</p><p>If Γ is the class of proper posets, subcomplete posets, or posets preserving the stationarity of subsets of ω 1 , we write F A &lt;ω 2 (Γ) as P F A, SCF A, or MM (Martin's Maximum) respectively.</p><p>It is more common to take the subscript to be the maximum allowable size of D rather than a strict upper bound. I have chosen to depart from this convention in order to allow general consistency proofs to be stated more cleanly and to handle the case where κ is a limit cardinal: while a classical forcing axiom up to but not including a limit cardinal is simply the conjunction of the axioms at each cardinal below the limit, this will not hold for the principles which we study later. As a reminder of this unusual notation, I write the &lt; explicitly in the subscript.</p><p>MA + ¬CH is equiconsistent with ZF C, essentially because all the dense sets involved can be taken to be small and the ccc is inherited by arbitary subposets, so forcing with the ccc posets smaller than the desired size of the continuum is sufficient to add the desired filters. This is not true of most other forcing classes, so consistency proofs for other forcing axioms typically follow Baumgartner's proof of Con(P F A) <ref type="bibr" coords="16,349.44,278.89,12.37,12.46" target="#b7">[8]</ref> in starting from a supercompact cardinal κ and harnessing its reflection properties to show that all the desired filters can be added by iterating posets below κ. This process in fact leads to a model of a stronger principle:</p><p>Definition 1.2.3. If ν ≤ ω 1 is a cardinal and Γ is a forcing class, F A +ν (Γ) is the statement that for all P ∈ Γ, all collections D of ω 1 dense subsets of P, and every sequence σ = σ α | α &lt; ν of P names for stationary subsets of ω 1 , there is a D-generic filter F ⊆ P such that σ F α is a stationary subset of ω 1 in V .</p><p>F A + (Γ) means F A +1 (Γ).

However, the following observations, essentially due to David Asperó in the last part of the proof of Theorem 2.6 in <ref type="bibr" coords="19,469.91,288.85,11.71,12.46" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, show that the two formulations are equivalent if, like Hamkins, one is only interested in the version of the maximality principle encompassing formulas of arbitrary complexity.

We can express Γ φ as "for all P, P ∈ Γ or P φ". The first clause of the disjunction is Π n and the second Σ n , so with the added universal quantifier we get a Π n+1 formula.

While symmetric bounded forcing axioms assert this only for collections of antichains small enough to be collapsed into the allowable parameter set of the corresponding maximality principle, more general forcing axioms assert it for antichains too large for this to work. (Of course one always can mimic the procedure in the proof of 1.3.3 to obtain a small B and Ā from a large Boolean algebra B and collection of maximal antichains A, but if some of the antichains in A are too large, the corresponding antichains in Ā will necessarily omit some of their conditions; then a generic G ⊂ B which meets those antichains at those omitted conditions will project to a filter on B which does not meet those antichains in Ā, so B does not force that there is a filter meeting all antichains in Ā, so we cannot apply a maximality principle to obtain a forcing axiom.)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="19,225.84,701.29,160.40,13.02">ZF C ⊢ Γ φ → ∀P ∈ Γ P Γ φ</formula><p>Thus classical forcing axioms can be viewed as a highly specific maximality principle intertwined with a reflection principle. Letting D be the set of all dense sets of a poset P in the ground model, it is forceably necessary that there is a filter meeting all elements of D; though we cannot hope to find such a filter in the ground model, we can consistently shrink D down to a set D smaller than the continuum (for ccc forcing) or ω 2 (for proper, semiproper, or subcomplete forcing) in a highly controlled way and find a ground-model filter meeting all dense sets in D.</p><p>By adding the ability to realize the truth of a forceably necessary formula with excessively large parameters in the ground model with a reflected parameter of reasonable size, unbounded and asymmetrically bounded forcing axioms gain considerable consistency strength over maximality principles, despite the restriction on allowable formulas. Our central goal may alternatively be stated as loosening this restriction on formulas, and in doing so unifying maximality principles with classical forcing axioms.</p></div>

If B is a Boolean algebra, p ∈ B, and A ⊂ B is an antichain maximal below p, then for any q ∈ B, A ∧ q := {a ∧ q | a ∈ A, a ∧ q &gt; 0} is an antichain maximal below p ∧ q (where we consider the empty set to be the unique antichain maximal below 0). Proof. A ∧ q is an antichain because for all a, b ∈ A such that a ∧ q, b ∧ q ∈ A ∧ q, any common lower bound of a ∧ q and b ∧ q is a common lower bound of a and b, so because A is an antichain it must be 0. A ∧ q is maximal below p ∧ q because for any nonzero r ≤ p ∧ q, since r ≤ p there is some a ∈ A such that r ∧ a &gt; 0 by the maximality of A; then since r ∧ a ≤ r ≤ p ∧ q ≤ q, r ∧ a ∧ q = r ∧ a &gt; 0, so r is compatible with a ∧ q ∈ A ∧ q. Lemma 1.5.7. If B is a complete Boolean algebra, κ is a regular cardinal, and ȧ ∈ H κ is a B-name, then there is a set of fewer than κ predense subsets of B, each of size less than κ, such that if F ⊆ B is a filter meeting all of them, ȧF = ȧ((F )) . Furthermore, this set of predense sets is an element of any transitive ZF C − model containing ȧ and B and is definable over any such model using ȧ and B as parameters.</p><p>Proof. We proceed by ∈-induction on ȧ. Assume that σ ∈ trcl({ ȧ}) is such that the lemma holds for all τ ∈ dom(σ). Then for each (of the fewer than κ) τ ∈ dom(σ), we have a cardinal λ τ &lt; κ and a collection of predense sets {A τ α | α &lt; λ τ }, each smaller than κ, such that if F is a filter meeting all of the A τ α , then τ F = τ ((F )) . Using the notation of Lemma 1.5.6, for each such τ and each α &lt; λ τ , we can form the predense set A τ α ∧ σ(τ ) ∪ {¬σ(τ )}. If F is any filter meeting all of these predense sets, then every element of σ F must have a name τ ∈ dom(σ) such that σ(τ ) ∈ F , so F must meet all the A τ α for this τ and thus τ F = τ ((F )) . Since τ ∈ σ ≥ σ(τ ), τ ((F )) ∈ σ ((F )) , so σ F ⊆ σ ((F )) . For the reverse inclusion, we require that for each τ ∈ dom(σ) F also meet the predense</p><formula xml:id="formula_25" coords="27,72.00,326.77,468.01,36.34">set B τ := { τ = ρ ∧ σ(ρ) | ρ ∈ dom(σ)} ∪ {¬ τ ∈ σ }. Then whenever τ ∈ σ ∈ F , putting τ ((F )) in σ ((F )) , there is some ρ ∈ dom(σ) such that ρ F ∈ σ F and τ = ρ ∈ F .</formula><p>Assuming F meets all the A τ α and A ρ α , τ F = τ ((F )) and ρ F = ρ ((F )) . Each x ∈ τ F has a name ẋ ∈ dom(τ ) such that τ ( ẋ) ∈ F , which by the definition of τ = ρ implies that ẋ ∈ ρ ∈ F , so τ F ⊆ ρ ((F )) . The same argument shows that ρ F ⊆ τ ((F )) , so both interpretations of each name are equal to both interpretations of the other. Therefore τ ((F )) ∈ σ F , so σ ((F )) ⊆ σ F and the two interpretations of σ by F are the same, provided F meets A τ α and B τ for all τ ∈ dom(σ) and α &lt; λ τ .</p><p>To see that the set of relevant predense sets is definable in ZF C − with ȧ and B as parameters, observe that each must initially arise as a B τ for some name τ ∈ trcl( ȧ) and then is modified only in very simple ways later on in the induction. Since the definition of B τ only involves Boolean values of atomic formulas, which are ∆ 1 -definable and therefore absolute to arbitrary transitive structures, each predense set we require F to meet and the set of all of them can be formed from subsets of trcl( ȧ) by applications of the collection axioms. This resulting set is then definable as the set of everything constructed by the end of the induction described above.</p><p>Going forward, we will usually make assumptions which allow us to satisfy the hypotheses of the preceding lemmas at no additional cost, so we will make no further use of the quasiinterpretation and use the other three interpretations interchangeably as is convenient.</p></div>

Thus given a ∆ 0 formula ψ(x, y) we can express T Σ 1 (⌈∃xψ⌉, a) as "there exists an x and a transitive structure S such that a, x ∈ S and S |= ψ(x, a)" and T Π 1 (⌈∀xψ⌉, a) as "for all x and all transitive structures S such that a, x ∈ S, S |= ψ(a, x)".

The only part that is not immediate from previous results is that the existence of regular C (n) cardinals for all n implies that Ord is Mahlo. For this, we first show that the hypothesis implies that for each n, there is a proper class of regular C (n) cardinals. Let κ ∈ C (n+2) be regular. Then for any α &lt; κ, V thinks there is a regular C (n) cardinal above it (namely κ), so V κ thinks there is a regular C (n) cardinal above α. Thus V κ satisfies the Π n+2 sentence "for every ordinal α, there is a regular C (n) cardinal above α", so V believes this as well, as desired. Now let φ be a Σ n formula defining a club class and κ a regular C (n) cardinal large enough for V κ to contain all the parameters used in φ. Then for any β &lt; κ, V thinks "there is some α &gt; β such that φ(α)", which is Σ n .

We would like to generalize F A + by allowing arbitrary names and arbitrary (or at least arbitrary Σ n ) provably Γ-persistent formulas rather than simply the stationarity of subsets of ω 1 , but as noted toward the end of Section 1.3, this is inconsistent, since most nontrivial forcing classes can make arbitrary sets smaller than some definable cardinal (such as ℵ 2 or 2 ℵ 0 ) of the forcing extension. To avoid this issue, we need to shrink our names down to a reasonable size before interpreting them. The previous lemma guides us on how to do that. Definition 3.1.2.

We might attempt to take the fragment T of the Σ n forcing relation for P involving only names in H γ and formulas which are provably Γ-persistent. The problems appear when we attempt to choose a particular forceable property of T to reflect, since we need to include some information about T in order for ZFC to prove that the formulas in it are preserved by further forcing. If we try to use "for all φ, ȧ ∈ T , φ is provably Γ-persistent and φ( ȧ) holds", then we can't prove in ZFC that the φ( ȧ) actually continue to hold in further forcing extensions, since ZFC does not prove its own soundness. We can avoid this issue by instead reflecting "for all φ, ȧ ∈ T , φ( ȧ) holds and is preserved by all forcing in Γ"; however, as noted in Lemma 1.3.6, this adds additional formula complexity.</p><p>axioms are equivalent to "name principles" asserting the existence of filters interpreting a name to have a certain property.

In the Σ 1 vs Σ 2 case, this is difficult to answer in general, but for most specific forcing classes of interest, results in later chapters will imply that we do get a separation. At n = 2, we can prove that moving one more level up produces strictly stronger axioms for a wide range of forcing classes, including for example all classes which can add arbitrarily many reals or collapse arbitrarily large cardinals. Proposition 3.3.1. Let Γ be an 2-nice forcing class and ∆ a forcing class which can destroy arbitrarily many inaccessibles, i.e. for any set X ⊂ Ord, there is a poset in ∆ which forces " X does not contain any inaccessible cardinals". Then if it is consistent that there is a supercompact cardinal with an inaccessible above it, Σ 2 -CF A &lt;κ (Γ) does not imply Σ 3 -MP ∆ (∅).</p><p>In particular, if Γ is a 2-nice forcing class which can destroy arbitrarily many inaccessibles,</p><formula xml:id="formula_148" coords="78,72.00,534.97,257.39,12.78">then Σ 2 -CF A &lt;κ (Γ) does not imply Σ 3 -CF A &lt;κ (Γ).</formula><p>Proof. By truncating the universe if necessary, we can assume that there is a model V with a supercompact κ with exactly one inaccessible λ above it. Applying Corollary 3.1.7, there is a forcing extension V [G] |= Σ 2 -CF A &lt;κ (Γ).

Since inaccessibility is a Π 1 property, the assertion "all ordinals are not inaccessible cardinals" is a Π 2 sentence. If there are only set many inaccessibles, there is some forcing in ∆ which destroys them all (without adding new ones, of course) and so makes this statement true. Since the statement is preserved by all further forcing, it holds in any model of the Σ 3 maximality principle for ∆ without a proper class of inaccessibles. As V [G] has a nonempty set of inaccessibles, it cannot satisfy Σ 3 -MP ∆ (∅).</p><p>It is tempting to try to generalize the above argument by replacing "inaccessible" with "regular C (n−1) ". However, the proof made essential use of the fact that forcing cannot add inaccessible cardinals, which need not hold for Σ n−1 -correctness when n &gt; 2. We could define ♦C (n) to be those cardinals which are Σ n -correct in some forcing extension, and then Σ n+2 -MP ∆ (∅) will imply that the intersection of ♦C (n) with the class of regular cardinals is empty or a proper class, but then it is no longer clear how to arrange that there is a model of Σ n+1 -CF A &lt;κ (Γ) with ♦C (n) ∩ Reg a nonempty set, since truncations at forceably Σ n -correct cardinals are not necessarily well-behaved.</p><p>We can, however, at least show that Σ n -correct forcing axioms become stronger when increasing n by at least two with a more elaborate geological argument.

If β is an ordinal, B is a Boolean algebra, and N is a transitive ZF C − model containing β and B such that N |= "β is a cardinal and B is a complete Boolean algebra", then a filter</p><formula xml:id="formula_159" coords="86,72.00,521.29,468.00,36.22">F ⊂ B is &lt; β-weakly N-generic iff F meets all maximal antichains A ∈ N of B such that |A| N &lt; β.</formula><p>Second, we need to limit the size of ȧ to ensure that it does not encode information about excessively large antichains. (This occurs most blatantly in situations involving formulas like " Ġ is a Ȟγ -generic filter" as in the proof of Theorem 3.2.5, but can also happen in more subtle ways.) The most precise smallness condition would be that if ẋ is a B-name in the transitive closure of { ȧ}, | ẋ| &lt; λ, where λ is our (strict) bound. However, we will instead require that ȧ ∈ H λ , since this is easier to state and work with than the more precise condition, Hence the last condition holds if we drop the requirement that the poset Q witnessing it</p><formula xml:id="formula_160" coords="91,72.00,132.62,58.27,15.33">is in V V [Gα] κ</formula><p>.

Then P Q ∈ Γ because Γ is provably self-preserving, so P×Q φ(ǎ) because φ is provably Γ-persistent. Since products commute and Q P ∈ Γ, it follows that Q (∃P ∈ Γ P φ(ǎ)), as desired. Thus by the residual reflection principle, there are stationarily many Z ≺ H λ of size less than κ containing a such that φ(π Z (a)) is Γ-forceable. Since π Z (a) ∈ H κ , the maximality principle yields φ(π Z (a)) in V . Thus the M-A formulation of Σ n -CBF A &lt;λ &lt;κ (Γ) holds, and bounded versions of the arguments for Theorem 3.2.5 yield the other formulations.</p><p>Thus for example Σ n -correct bounded forcing axioms for countably closed forcing can be factored into the Σ n -maximality principle for countably closed forcing and a Σ n -residual reflection principle when n ≥ 2. The same holds for ccc ccc when n ≥ 3 (the ccc is a ∆ 2 property because it holds iff it holds in H θ for some uncountable θ iff it holds in H θ for all uncountable θ such that the poset is itself in H θ ). Furthermore, since by the results of the next chapter Σ 2 -MP ccc (H 2 ℵ 0 ) implies that CH fails badly and by Proposition 1.3.3 it also implies MA, Proposition 7.0.6(b) yields that ccc ccc = ccc under the hypotheses of the above theorem when Γ = ccc. Thus Σ n -CBMA &lt;λ is equivalent to the conjunction of the Σ n -maximality principle for ccc forcing and Σ n -RRP (2 ℵ 0 , λ, ccc) when n ≥ 3, but not necessarily when n = 2. Even though ccc forcing has a Σ 2 definition, we must use the more complex definition of ccc ccc in order for the preservation to be provable in ZF C alone.</p><p>For other forcing classes, such as subcomplete, proper, or semiproper forcing, even shifting to more complex definitions does not appear to help. Examining the consistency proofs for Σ n -correct forcing axioms sheds some light on the obstacle: when there is a P ∈ Γ V [G] forcing φ( ȧ), we can find an N, σ, and F such that φ(σ −1 ( ȧ) F ) already holds not because there is some Q ∈ Γ V [G] forcing this, as would be required for a straightforward maximality principle argument to work, but because there is such a Q which was in Γ as defined inside of some ground model V [G α ]. Thus perhaps, in order to get a factorization for a wider range of forcing classes, a more geological approach is needed. For now, the following (somewhat vague) question remains open: Question 7. Is Σ n -CBF A &lt;λ &lt;κ (Γ) equivalent to the conjunction of some sort of generalized maximality principle and some sort of reflection principle for a wide number of natural forcing classes?</p><p>Further open questions arise from the fact that, although the proof of Theorem 7.0.7 does not appear to generalize beyond the provably self-preserving classes, it is unclear how to establish the separations that would definitively show that the theorem does not generalize: Question 8. If Γ is a forcing class which is never self-preserving, is it consistent for suitable κ that Σ n -MP Γ (H κ ) and Σ n -RRP (κ, λ, Γ) hold but Σ n -CBF A &lt;λ &lt;κ (Γ) fails?</p><p>Question 9.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Combinatorics</head><p>This sections surveys some of the combinatorial consequences of Σ n -correct forcing axioms, starting with the tree property:</p><p>Proposition 8.2.1.</p><p>1. Σ 2 -CBMA &lt;c + (or merely Σ 2 -RRP (c, c + , ccc)) implies that the continuum has the tree property.</p><p>2. If Γ is an n-nice forcing class, then Σ n+1 -RRP (κ, κ + , Γ) implies that for every κ-tree, there is a Γ-extension in which it has a cofinal branch.</p><p>Proof. (1): Assume toward a contradiction that T = (c, &lt; T ) is a c-tree with no cofinal branch. Having no cofinal branch is a Π 1 property of c and T , since it amounts to saying that all functions from c with the ordinal ordering to T fail to be strictly order-preserving.</p><p>To see that it is provably ccc-persistent, let P satisfy the ccc and ḃ be a P-name for a cofinal branch of T ; we can assume without loss of generality that all conditions of P force ḃ to be a cofinal branch. Define T ḃ := {x ∈ T | ∃p ∈ P p x ∈ ḃ}.</p><p>Since ḃ is forced to be a cofinal branch, T ḃ contains at least one element from every level of T . However, conditions of P which force different elements of the same level to be in ḃ are incompatible, so by the ccc there are at most countably many conditions for each level. It follows that each level of T ḃ is at most countable. As CH fails under our hypotheses, T ḃ is a tree of height c with width uniformly bounded below c, so by a standard result of Kurepa (see e.g. Kanamori Proposition 7.9 <ref type="bibr" coords="123,253.41,661.81,17.36,12.46" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), it has a cofinal branch, which is then also a cofinal branch of T in V .</p><p>subsets of [θ] ω , which is provably Γ-persistent because every poset in Γ is proper, by the residual reflection principle there is a Z ≺ H λ of size less than κ with X ∪(ν+1)∪ω 1 ∪{θ, S} ⊂ Z such that, setting θ := π Z (θ) and S := π Z (S), S is a ν-sequence of stationary subsets of Z ; then h ′ : [ θ] &lt;ω → θ, so there is some ā ∈ π Z (S α ) closed under it and transitive below ω 1 by stationarity. Then ā = π Z (a) for some a ∈ S α because all elements of π Z (S α ) are of this form. For any finite {β 1 , . . . , β k } ⊂ a, π Z ({β 1 , . . . , β k }) = {π Z (β 1 ), . . . , π Z (β k )} ⊂ ā, since as argued in the previous paragraph a ⊂ Z in this situation. Hence h ′ ({π Z (β 1 ), . . . , π Z (β k )}) = π Z (h({β 1 , . . . , β k })) ∈ ā, so h({β 1 , . . . , β k }) ∈ a by elementarity. It follows that a is closed under h; to see that it is furthermore transitive below ω 1 , note that π Z does not move countable ordinals or map uncountable ordinals to countable because ω 1 ⊂ Z, so this follows from the fact that ā ∩ ω 1 is transitive. Therefore π −1 Z "π Z (S α ) is stationary in [Y ] ω , so S α ∩ [Y ] ω is as well, as desired.</p><p>Theorem 8.2.5. If λ &gt; ω 2 is a regular cardinal and Γ is a forcing class which provably preserves stationary subsets of ω 1 , Σ 2 -CBF A &lt;λ &lt;ω 2 (Γ) implies ω 1 -RP (θ) for all regular θ ≥ ω 2 such that θ ω 1 &lt; λ and there is a proper poset in Γ which collapses θ to ω 1 . Thus if Γ can ω 1 . Set g := σ • σ −1 ( ḟ ) F , so that g : ω 1 → θ is injective, and let Y := rng(g).</p><p>Then |Y | = ω 1 because dom(g) = ω 1 , Y ⊂ θ because σ preserves the order of ordinals, and X ⊆ Y because X ⊆ rng(σ) ∩ θ = σ"σ −1 (θ) = rng(g). To verify that Y reflects the stationarity of the S α , let C ⊆ [Y ] ω be a club. Then since {g"β | β &lt; ω 1 } can easily be verified to be a club in [Y ] ω using the fact that g : ω 1 → Y is a bijection, the intersection C g := {g"β ∈ C | β &lt; ω 1 } is a club as well. We now verify that {β &lt; ω 1 | g"β ∈ C} is a club in ω 1 . It is unbounded because for any δ &lt; ω 1 , by the unboundedness of C g there is a β &lt; ω 1 with g"δ ⊆ g"β ∈ C, and since g is injective we must have δ ≤ β. It is closed because for any increasing sequence β n | n &lt; ω in it with supremum β ω , n&lt;ω g"β n ∈ C g because C g is closed, so since direct images commute with unions we have g"β ω ∈ C. Fix α &lt; ω 1 . From the above paragraph, it follows that there is a β ∈ σ −1 ( ȧ) F α such that g"β ∈ C. By one of the conditions on σ −1 ( ȧ) F , σ −1 ( ḟ ) F "β ∈ σ −1 (S α ). Hence σ(σ −1 ( ḟ ) F "β) ∈ S α , and since |σ −1 ( ḟ ) F "β| = ω &lt; crit(σ), σ(σ −1 ( ḟ ) F "β) = σ"(σ −1 ( ḟ ) F "β) = g"β. It follows that g"β ∈ C ∩ S α ∩ [Y ] ω , so the stationarity of each S α reflects to Y , as desired.</p></div>

Of course, the existence of 0 ♯ follows from the Σ 2 -correct forcing axioms for a wide range of forcing classes by the stationary reflection results of the previous section, but the proof in the case of ccc forcing (and other cardinal-preserving classes) is considerably more straightforward, and fairly striking given the low consistency strength of (Σ 1 -correct) Martin's Axiom. Theorem 8.3.2. If Σ n -CF A &lt;κ (Γ) holds (or merely Σ n -RRP (κ, λ, Γ) for all λ), then Vopenka's principle holds for all proper classes with provably Γ-persistent Σ n definitions.</p><p>Proof. Let φ define the class and let A be a structure of size at least κ in the class.

However, I will not further explore that possibility here. Finally, in line with the results of Bagaria (mentioned after Proposition 2.2.10) on the connection between the Vopenka scheme and strengthenings of extendibility, we can get a sort of generic C (n) -extendibility from Σ n+2 -correct forcing axioms: Proposition 8.3.4.

Assume that no such j exists and let φ(V α , κ) denote the assertion that for all P ∈ Γ and ordinals β, if P forces that there is an elementary embedding j : Vα → V β with crit(j) = κ and j(κ) ∈ Vα , then P forces that β ∈ C (n) . Then φ is Π n+1 because by Corollary 2.1.3 the assertion β ∈ C (n) is Σ n , quantifying over all P ∈ Γ adds a Π n+1 disjunct, and the rest of the statement adds only universal quantifiers and conjuncts or disjuncts of the same or lower complexity.

However, the trivial forcing forces that α is an ordinal such that σ restricts to an elementary embedding j : σ −1 (V α ) → V α with crit(j) = crit(σ) = κ, j(κ) = σ(κ) = κ ∈ σ −1 (V α ), and α ∈ C (n) , contradicting φ(σ −1 (V α ), κ).

For C ′ , first note that {Z ∈ [H λ ] &lt;κ | Z ∩ κ ∈ κ} is a club,so by intersecting it with C ′ we can assume that Z ∩ κ is transitive for all Z ∈ C ′ . Now we recursively construct a sequenceZ α | α &lt; κ in C ′ . Let Z 0 be an arbitrary element of C ′ , at successor stages invoke the unboundedness of C ′ to arrange Z α ∪ {Z α ∩ κ} ⊆ Z α+1 ∈ C ′ , and at limit stages γ &lt; κ use the closure of C ′ to set Z γ := α&lt;γ Z α .Then the map α → Z α ∩ κ is a strictly increasing function κ → κ, so its range is unbounded in κ, and by the definition at limit stages it is continuous, so its range is also closed. Hence{Z α ∩ κ | α &lt; κ} is a club in κ contained in {Z ∩ κ | Z ∈ C ′ ∧ Z ∩ κ ∈ κ}, as desired.For stationary sets, if S ⊆ κ is stationary, then for any clubC ⊆ [H λ ] &lt;κ , S ∩ {Z ∩ κ | Z ∈ C ∧ Z ∩ κ ∈ κ} = ∅ by the above, so every Z such that Z ∩ κ is in that intersection lies in {Z ∈ [H λ ] &lt;κ | Z ∩ κ ∈ S} ∩ C.Thus the latter intersection is also nonempty, so {Z ∈ [H λ ] &lt;κ | Z ∩ κ ∈ S} is stationary.

This is false for classical forcing axioms, since Reitz showed that the existence of a supercompact cardinal is consistent with the failure of the Bedrock Axiom (<ref type="bibr" coords="112,386.28,499.09,17.28,12.46" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Corollary 25(2)) and this failure is preserved by set forcing, but may become true at the Σ 3 level or above.In light of Theorem 6.1.1, it is natural to wonder whether asymmetrically bounded or unbounded Σ n -correct forcing axioms can be factored as the conjunction of the appropriate Σ n maximality principle and some sort of reflection principle. The attempted factorization chronicled in this chapter only works for a few forcing classes, but the resulting reflection principles have some independent interest. Definition 7.0.1. For n a positive integer, κ ≤ λ uncountable cardinals, and Γ a forcing class, Σ n -RRP (κ, λ, Γ) is the assertion that for all provably Γ-persistent Σ n formulas φ and all a ∈ H λ such that φ(a) holds, the set of Z ≺ H λ of size less than κ and containing a such that φ(π Z (a)) holds is stationary in [H λ ] &lt;κ . These statements can be called residual reflection principles, because they are all that remains of Σ n -correct H λ -reflection after a length κ iteration of posets in Γ ∩ V κ : λ , κ ∈ rng(σ), φ(σ −1 (a)) holds, and σ(crit(σ)) = κ. Since H (2 &lt;λ ) + |= "H λ is closed under h", rng(σ) ∩ H λ is as well. rng(σ) ∩ H λ ≺ H λ because H (2 &lt;λ ) + and rng(σ) agree on which formulas H λ satisfies. Therefore rng(σ) ∩ H λ is an elementary substructure of H λ of size less than κ which is closed under h and transitive below κ such that φ(σ −1 (a)) holds, and (a restriction of) σ −1 is exactly the transitive collapse isomorphism of rng(σ) ∩ H λ .

If Σ n+2 -CF A &lt;κ (Γ) holds for some Σ n -definable Γ, then for all P ∈ Γ, regular cardinals γ such that P ∈ H γ , and X ⊆ H γ such that |X| &lt; κ, there is a transitive structure N with an elementary embedding σ : N → H γ such that X ∪ {P} ⊆ rng(σ) and a Σ n -correct N-generic filter F , i.e. for all σ −1 (P)-names ȧ ∈ N and all Σ n formulas φ such that P "φ(σ( ȧ)) holds and is preserved by all further forcing in Γ", φ( ȧF ) holds.</p><p>Consequently, if Σ n -CF A &lt;κ (Γ) holds for all n ∈ ω, for all n we can find a structure with a Σ n -correct generic filter.</p><p>Proof. Given P, γ, and X, let T = { φ, ẋ | ẋ ∈ H P γ ∧ P Γ φ( ẋ)}, and let τ be the Pname such that for any filter F , τ F = { φ, ẋF | φ, ẋ ∈ T }. Since Γ φ is Π n+1 , the statement " Γ φ(x) holds for all φ, x ∈ τ " can be expressed as a Π n+1 formula ψ(τ ), which is forced by P. Because Γ φ is provably Γ-persistent, ψ is as well. If γ ′ is sufficiently large that τ, H γ ∈ H γ ′ , then there is an elementary embedding σ ′ : N ′ → H γ ′ such that X ∪ {P, τ, H γ } ⊆ rng(σ ′ ) and an N ′ -generic filter F ⊆ P := σ ′−1 (P) such that ψ(σ ′−1 (τ ) F ) holds.</p><p>Let N := σ ′−1 (H γ ).

By ψ(σ ′−1 (τ ) F ), φ( ȧF ) holds for each such pair. Thus if we set σ = σ ′ ↾ N, σ : N → H γ is an elementary embedding with all the desired properties and F is a Σ n -correct N-generic filter.</p></div>

We plan to apply the Jensen formulation to the formula φ and the name b; the only difficulty is ensuring that the set of possible ranges of the embedding σ is stationary in [H λ ] &lt;κ . For this, let h : [H λ ] &lt;ω → H λ ; we will produce a Z ≺ H λ of size less than κ, containing b, and closed under h such that Z ∩ H κ is transitive and φ(π Z (b)) holds.</p><p>Let γ be a regular cardinal large enough that H λ ∈ H γ .

That Z is smaller than κ and transitive below κ is immediate. That φ(π Z (b)) holds follows from the fact that π Z is a restriction of σ −1 , while Z ≺ H λ is a consequence of Lemma B.0.3. Finally, if Z and g are such that σ( Z) = H λ and σ(g) = h, then by elementarity Z is closed under g. Since every finite subset of Z is of the form {σ(x 1 ), . . . σ(x k )} for some x 1 , . . . , x k ∈ Z and g({x 1 , . . . , x k }) ∈ Z, by elementarity h({σ(x 1 ), . . . , σ(x k )}) = σ(g({x 1 , . . . , x k })) ∈ Z.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 8 Consequences</head><p>We conclude with a brief survey of some of the implications of Σ n -correct forcing axioms. It is highly likely that they have many more consequences, perhaps including some much more dramatic than those explored here, but the constraints of time, space, and my own limited knowledge will restrict us to only these few. Particular attention will be paid to Σ n -correct Martin's Axiom, since for n ≥ 2 it has a somewhat different character than and in particular is much stronger than ordinary Martin's Axiom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">The Cardinality of the Continuum</head><p>We begin with some simple observations on the implications for various axioms on the size of the continuum. (1) follows from the well-known fact that P F A implies that the continuum is ℵ 2 . 113</p><p>(2): Since ω 1 is ∆ 2 definable without parameters and P(ω) is Π 1 -definable, the assertion that there is a bijection between them is Σ 2 . Since Coll(ω 1 , c) is a countably closed (and hence subcomplete) poset which forces CH, and neither subcomplete nor countably closed posets add reals, either Σ 2 -correct forcing axiom implies CH. In fact, CH follows merely from the corresponding Σ 2 maximality principles.</p><p>(3): First, we show (following Stavi and Vaananen <ref type="bibr" coords="121,351.71,231.13,18.23,12.46" target="#b39">[40]</ref>) that Σ 2 -MP ccc (H c ) implies that the continuum is weakly inaccessible. First, by Proposition 1.3.3, it implies MA and thus that the continuum is regular. To see that the continuum is a weak limit cardinal, let λ &lt; c.</p><p>Since P(ω) is Π 1 definable without parameters and λ ++ is ∆ 2 in λ, "there is an injective function λ ++ → P(ω)" is a Σ 2 statement which can be forced by adding λ ++ reals and, since ccc forcing preserves cardinals, provably remains true after any further ccc forcing. Thus it holds in V , so the continuum cannot be λ + . Now strengthen our hypotheses to Σ 2 -CBMA &lt;c + . (Ordinary Martin's Axiom is equivalent to all of its bounded forms, since by definition a ccc Boolean algebra only has small antichains, but this fails for the Σ n -correct versions, since the boundedness will restrict the size of the names that can be used as parameters.) Let C ⊆ c be a club. Then "sup(C) is weakly inaccessible" is a true Π 1 formula provably preserved by ccc forcing because ccc forcing preserves weak inaccessibility, so applying the Miyamoto-Aperó form of the axiom, there is a Z ≺ H c + of size less than c containing c and C such that the supremum of π Z (C) further implies that any such class containing c must be stationary below it.</p><p>Proof. Let φ be a provably ccc-persistent Σ n formula such that φ(c) holds. Then any ccc forcing which adds at least (c V ) + reals forces "there is an α smaller than the continuum such that φ(α) holds". Since any further ccc forcing preserves φ(c V ) and cannot decrease the continuum, the quoted property corresponds to a provably ccc-persistent formula; because the cardinality of the continuum is ∆ 2 -definable, this formula is also Σ n as long as n ≥ 2.</p><p>Thus by the maximality principle, there is some α &lt; c V such that V |= φ(α), as desired.</p><p>If Σ n -RRP (c, c + , ccc) holds, then there are stationarily many Z ∈ [H c + ] &lt;c such that Z ∩ κ is transitive (and thus equal to π Z (κ)) and φ(π Z (κ)) holds. Thus by Lemma B.0.2,</p><p>Of course, similar results hold for other forcing classes, but since ccc forcing preserves more properties related to the size of cardinals (most notably the cofinality function), this particular case is more relevant to characterizing how large the continuum is under Σ n -CMA (whereas the Σ n -correct forcing axioms for other natural classes often imply that κ is merely</p><p>The first result of the following section can be interpreted as saying that under Σ 2 -correct Martin's Axiom, the continuum is "very weakly compact" (i.e. weakly inaccessible and has Thus T 's lack of a cofinal branch is a provably ccc-persistent Π 1 property, so there are stationarily many Z ≺ H c + of size less than c such that π Z (T ) has no cofinal branch. Fix a particular such Z which is closed under the mapping from ordinals α &lt; c to the αth level of T and transitive below c. Combining these two properties, every node of T below level π Z (c) is in Z, but by elementarity Z contains no nodes from higher levels, so π Z (T ) = T ↾ π Z (c).</p><p>Thus T ↾ π Z (c) has no cofinal branch, contradicting the fact that T π Z (c) is nonempty. Hence c must have the tree property under our hypotheses.</p><p>(2): Assume toward a contradiction that T is a κ-tree with no cofinal branch in any Γ-extension. By Lemma 1.3.6, this is a provably Γ-persistent Π n property. Then we can argue as above to produce a Z ≺ H κ + such that π Z (T ) = T ↾ π Z (κ) has no cofinal branch in any Γ-extension, contradicting the fact that the predecessors of any node of height π Z (κ) in</p><p>Next, some implications of the Σ n -correct forcing axioms for subcomplete or countably closed forcing: Proposition 8.2.2. Let Γ be the class of subcomplete forcing or the class of countably closed forcing. Then Σ 2 -CF A &lt;ω 2 (Γ) implies:</p><p>1. ♦ 2. There are no (ω 1 -)Kurepa trees Proof. In fact, both consequences follows from Σ 2 -MP Γ (H ω 2 ).</p><p>(1): It is a standard result that adding a Cohen subset to ω 1 forces ♦ (see e.g. Kunen's Lemma IV.7.30 <ref type="bibr" coords="124,153.95,638.53,17.36,12.46" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). This forcing is countably closed and thus subcomplete. Jensen proved ( <ref type="bibr" coords="124,76.34,662.41,17.36,12.46" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Part 3, Lemma 4) that subcomplete forcing and thus countably closed forcing 1 preserves ♦. ♦ is a Σ 2 sentence, since it asserts that there is a sequence A α | α &lt; ω 1 such that for 1 The result for countably closed forcing was in fact known well before Jensen.</p></div>

Thus ♦ follows from the maximality principles for both forcing classes.</p><p>(2): Let T ∈ H ω 2 be an ω 1 -tree. Then there is a countably closed (hence subcomplete)</p><p>forcing to add a surjection from ω 1 to the set of cofinal branches of T , and further subcomplete forcing provably does not add branches to T by Minden's Theorem 3.1.2 <ref type="bibr" coords="125,440.88,207.25,17.09,12.46" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Asserting that T is not a Kurepa tree is Σ 2 , since we can say that there is a function f with domain ω 1 such that every strictly order-preserving map ω 1 → T with downward-closed range is itself in the range of f . Thus T not being a Kurepa tree is a Γ-forceable and provably Γ-persistent Σ 2 formula, so T is not a Kurepa tree in V . Since every ω 1 -tree is isomorphic to one in H ω 2 it follows that there are no Kurepa trees at all.</p><p>Finally, we consider the following version of simultaneous stationary reflection: Proof. Whenever the specified bounds on ν and θ hold, given S and X as in the above definition, S ∈ H λ . Since there is a Π 1 formula asserting that S is a ν-sequence of stationary collapse arbitrarily large cardinals to ω 1 with proper posets, Σ 2 -CF A &lt;ω 2 (Γ) implies ω 1 -RP .</p><p>Proof. This is essentially an adaptation of Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah's argument that <ref type="bibr" coords="127,238.56,169.33,12.96,12.46" target="#b9">10]</ref>, paragraph before Theorem 13). Given θ, a sequence of stationary subsets of [θ] ω S = S α | α &lt; ω 1 ∈ H λ , X ⊂ θ of size ω 1 , and a proper P ∈ Γ which collapses θ to ω 1 , let ḟ and ȧ be P-names such that P " ḟ : ω1 → θ is a bijection" and</p><p>To show that P forces ȧ to be an ω 1 -sequence of stationary subsets of ω 1 , let G ⊂ P be</p><p>, since by the surjectivity of ḟ G every countable subset of θ is contained in ḟ G "β for some β, and Returning to V , we have shown P ∈ Γ forces ȧ to be a sequence of stationary subsets of ω 1 and by hypothesis ZF C proves that every poset in Γ preserves this Π 1 property, but in the case where we wish to apply the bounded form of the axiom, we need additionally that ȧ ∈ H λ . Observe that for each β &lt; ω 1 , there are θ possible values of ḟ (β), so the values of ḟ are determined by ω 1 many antichains of P each of size at most θ. Since ȧ is entirely determined by the values of ḟ , we can assume without loss of generality that only these conditions of P appear in its transitive closure, and by replacing P with an isomorphic poset if necessary, we can arrange that they are all in H λ , so ȧ is as well.</p><p>Hence for arbitrary regular γ &gt; λ, we can find an elementary embedding σ : N → H γ for transitive N of size ω 1 with ω 1 + 1 ∪ X ∪ {θ, λ, P, ȧ, ḟ , S} ⊂ rng(σ) and a &lt;σ −1 (λ)-weakly N-generic filter F ⊂ σ −1 (P) such that σ −1 ( ȧ) F is an ω 1 -sequence of stationary subsets of ω 1 ,</p></div>

Now let x = ẋG , where ẋ is a P-name but perhaps not in H κ . We can then define in V: Lemma B.0.7.

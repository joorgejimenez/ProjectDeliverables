A poset Q contains a poset P if there is an injective poset homomorphism π : P → Q. If Q does not contain P we say that Q is P -free. All posets considered in this paper are finite.</p><p>Given a poset P and two elements x, z ∈ P , we say that x covers z if x &gt; z and there is no y ∈ P with x &gt; y &gt; z. We define the Hasse diagram of P , denoted H(P ), as a graph with vertex set P drawn in the plane such that we draw an edge from x to y upwards only if y covers x (we allow edges to cross in the drawing). A poset P is a tree poset if H(P ) is a tree. The height of a poset is the length of the longest maximal chain of P .</p><p>For a fixed poset P and positive integer n, define the size of a largest P -free set system in 2 [n] as La(n, P ). The systematic study of La(n, P ), began with the work of Katona and Tarján <ref type="bibr" coords="1,502.56,523.69,17.09,11.97" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The following conjecture has been central to the study of La(n, P ) which has been formulated in many places with slight variations, see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,217.08,552.61,12.36,11.97" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,233.88,552.61,9.12,11.97" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,247.44,552.61,13.68,11.97" target="#b10">11]</ref>. For positive integers n and x &lt; n, we let [n]   x denote the family of all subsets of 2 [n] of size x.</p><p>Conjecture 1.1. Let P be a poset, then La(n, P ) = e(P ) n ⌊n/2⌋</p><p>(1 + o(1)),</p><p>where e(P ) denotes the largest integer ℓ such that for all j and n the family ℓ i=1</p><p>[n] i+j is P -free.</p><p>Conjecture 1.1 can be viewed as a broad generalization of the classical Sperner's Theorem <ref type="bibr" coords="2,45.60,95.05,17.18,11.97" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The smallest unresolved case for Conjecture 1.1 is the 2-dimensional Boolean lattice (i.e., the diamond poset), which has received significant attention in the literature, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,446.52,109.57,12.36,11.97" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.84,109.57,15.00,11.97" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,481.92,109.57,14.88,11.97" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,500.88,109.57,13.59,11.97" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Only very recently, Conjecture 1.1 has been disproven in the case when P is the d-dimensional Boolean lattice for d ≥ 4, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.48,138.37,11.70,11.97" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For a broader overview of the history of Conjecture 1.1, see the survey of Griggs and Li <ref type="bibr" coords="2,121.56,152.89,18.24,11.97" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or the textbook of Gerber and Patkós <ref type="bibr" coords="2,345.84,152.89,12.36,11.97" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,362.76,152.89,54.20,11.97">Chapter 7]</ref>. As e(P ) = k − 1 for all tree posets P of height k, the following theorem of Bukh proves Conjecture 1.1 for all tree posets. Theorem 1.2.

Our main result is proving Conjecture 1.3 for all tree posets.</p><p>Theorem 1.4. Let P be a tree poset of height k, then the number of P -free set systems in 2 [n] is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,251.64,376.26,92.04,16.96">2 (1+o(1))(k−1)( n ⌊n/2⌋ ) .</formula><p>Boris Bukh <ref type="bibr" coords="2,126.12,402.49,12.24,11.97" target="#b4">[5]</ref> observed that Theorem 1.2 also extends to a larger class of posets that embed into trees in an ideal way. This same observation extends to our Theorem 1.4 as well. Recall that e(P ) denotes the largest integer ℓ such that for all j and n the family ℓ i=1</p><p>[n] i+j is P -free. Corollary 1.5. Let P be a poset and Q be a tree poset of height k such that e(P ) = k − 1 and Q contains P . Then the number of P -free set systems in 2 [n] is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,251.64,485.82,92.04,17.08">2 (1+o(1))(k−1)( n ⌊n/2⌋ ) .</formula><p>Proof. As e(P ) = k − 1 we have that k−2 i=0</p><p>[n]</p><p>⌊n/2⌋+i and each of its subfamilies is P -free. This implies that the number of P -free set systems in 2 [n] is at least 2 (1+o(1))(k−1)( n ⌊n/2⌋ ) . By Theorem 1.4, the number of Q-free is at most 2 (1+o(1))(k−1)( n ⌊n/2⌋ ) . As Q contains P , the corollary follows.</p><p>One of the smallest nontrivial posets Corollary 1.5 applies to is the butterfly poset B, see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,82.68,586.69,4.56,11.97" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As e(B) = 2 and B is contained in the X poset, see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,405.48,586.69,4.56,11.97" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, by Corollary 1.5, we have that Conjecture 1.3 is true for the butterfly poset as well.</p><p>There are two natural potential extensions of our results. One is to extend to P -free posets, where we forbid P as an induced subposet, see the relevant conjecture of Gerbner, Nagy, Patkós, and Vizer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,101.88,644.41,12.36,11.97" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,119.88,644.41,69.96,11.97">Conjecture 9]</ref> or the extensions of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.44,644.41,12.36,11.97" target="#b4">[5]</ref> by Boehnlein and Jiang <ref type="bibr" coords="2,452.52,644.41,11.70,11.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The second is to investigate random variants of our results, see for example <ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.16,658.93,17.18,11.97" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which would require proving stronger supersaturation conditions.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some preliminary results. Then, we proceed to prove our supersaturation results Corollaries 2.11 and 2.12. We then prove our main container result, Lemma 2.15.

For every tree poset P of size m and an element x ∈ P , there is a total ordering ≺ of the elements of P , which we write as x = x 1 ≺ . . . ≺ x m and such that for each i ∈ [m], the induced subgraph H(P )[x 1 , . . . , x i ] is a tree such that x i has degree 1. Definition 2.3. For a tree poset P , an element x ∈ P , a total ordering of P beginning at x as described in Claim 2.2, and a positive integer t, define the t-blowup of P centered at x, denoted P (x, t), to be the poset constructed as follows. Replace each x i ∈ P with t d(x i ) copies of x i , where d(x i ) := d(x, x i ) is the distance from x to x i in the Hasse diagram H(P ). Label the copies of x i as x i,1 , . . . , x i,t d(x i ) .</p><p>For each i &gt; 1, there is exactly one edge x i x j in H(p) such that d(x i ) = d(x j ) + 1 and i &gt; j. We split the copies of x i into t d(x i )−1 sets V i,k = {x i,(k−1)t+1 , . . . , x i,kt } for k ∈ [t d(x i )−1 ]. When x i covers x j in P , we set x j,k &gt; P (x,t) v for all v ∈ V i,k . Otherwise, x j covers x i in P , and we set x j,k &lt; P (x,t) v for all v ∈ V i,k .</p><p>Notice that although there are possibly multiple choices for the order as described in Claim 2.2, the poset P (x, t) is unique up to isomorphism. Furthermore, the indexing of the elements of P (x, t) induces a total ordering given by the lexicographic ordering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Supersaturation tools</head><p>Unless otherwise stated, we follow the notation and terminology of West <ref type="bibr" coords="3,417.60,658.93,18.24,11.97" target="#b17">[18]</ref> with regard to partial orders. We say a finite poset is graded if every maximal chain has the same size. Thus our notion of graded poset of height k corresponds to the notion of k-saturated posets of Bukh <ref type="bibr" coords="3,506.88,687.85,11.70,11.97" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We have changed this terminology to avoid potential conflict with the notion of a k-saturated chain decomposition with respect to the classical Greene-Kleitman Theorem <ref type="bibr" coords="3,414.00,716.65,11.70,11.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Thus in a graded tree poset, every leaf in the Hasse diagram must be a minimal or maximal element. The following lemma shows that every tree poset is contained in a graded tree poset. As observed in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,462.12,229.21,11.70,11.97" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, working with graded posets is simpler.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,94.75,84.98,405.43,73.35">x 1 x 2 x 4 x 3 x 1,1 x 2,1 x 2,2 x 4,1 x 4,2 x 3,1 x 3,2 x 4,3 x 4,4</formula><p>Lemma 2.4.

Then there exists a graded tree poset P of height k such that P is an induced subposet of P and | P | ≤ sk, where s denotes the number of maximal chains of P .</p><p>Remark 2.5. The inequality | P | ≤ sk is not in the original statement of [5, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,442.92,321.37,50.99,11.97">Lemma 5]</ref> but can be read out of its proof.</p><p>Lemma 2.6. Let P be a graded tree poset of height k, x ∈ P and a is some positive integer. Then P (x, a) is a graded tree poset of height k.</p><p>Proof. Clearly, P has height k if and only if P (x, a) has height k. Further, every maximal chain of P (x, a) corresponds to a maximal chain of P in the natural way, hence P (x, a) is also graded. Furthermore, by its definition, the Hasse diagram of P (x, a) is also a tree.</p><p>An interval of a poset P is a set of the form {z ∈ P : x ≤ z ≤ y} where x, y ∈ P . It is easy to check that for tree posets, an interval is either the empty set or a chain. Lemma 2.7.

To complete the proof, we must find a maximal chain C s+1 of P such that I s+1 ⊆ C s+1 and (i), (ii), and (iii) holds for C 1 , . . . , C s , C s+1 .</p><p>Letting I 1 = C 1 , by (i) and (ii), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="5,234.00,263.16,127.32,36.65">s i=1 I i = s i=1 C i = P \ I s+1 .</formula><p>By (ii), there exists a unique j such that u ∈ I j .

To count all possible P -free set systems F , first we count the number of possible pairs (H, G).

We are now ready to present our container algorithm. Lemma 2.13. For every tree poset P , an element x ∈ P , an integer t, and a set system S ⊆ 2 [n] , there is a collection C of pairs (H, G) with H, G ⊆ S such that: (i) For each P -free set system F ⊆ S, there is a pair (H, G) ∈ C such that H ⊆ F ⊆ H ∪ G.</p><p>(ii) For each (H, G) ∈ C, G is P (x, t)-free and |H| ≤ |P ||S|/t.</p><p>(iii) For each H ⊆ S there is at most one G ⊆ S such that (H, G) ∈ C.</p><p>Proof. Throughout this proof we will use three total orderings, a total ordering ≺ 1 of the elements of P , i.e., x = x 1 ≺ 1 . . . ≺ 1 x |P | given by Claim 2.2, the total ordering ≺ 2 of the elements of P (x, t) given by the lexicographic ordering as discussed in Definition 2.3 and a total ordering ≺ 3 of the copies of P (x, t) in 2 [n] .</p><p>We give a deterministic algorithm that takes as input a P -free set system F ⊆ S and outputs the pair (H, G). We initialize the variables H 0 = ∅ and G 0 = S. The following algorithm runs in possibly multiple iterations.</p><p>We describe iteration i ≥ 0 of the algorithm as follows. If G i is P (x, t)-free, then the algorithm terminates and outputs (H i , G i ). Otherwise G i contains a copy of P (x, t) and we let π : P (x, t) → G i denote a respective embedding. We further suppose π(P (x, t)) ⊆ G i is the first copy of P (x, t) under the ordering ≺ 3 . With the given (H i , G i ) and F we apply the following embedding procedure to obtain a new pair (H i+1 , G i+1 ):</p><p>1. If π(x 1,1 ) / ∈ F then we set H i+1 = H i and G i+1 = G i \ π(x 1,1 ) and we begin iteration i + 1 with (H i+1 , G i+1 ).</p><p>2. If π(x 1,1 ) ∈ F then we let Q 1 := {π(x 1,1 )}.</p><p>3. Let Q j := {π(x 1,r 1 ), . . . , π(x j,r j )} such that Q j is a subposet of P induced by the first j elements of the ordering ≺ 1 . Then x j+1 is the first vertex of ≺ 1 which is not embedded. By Claim 2.2, there is exactly one x k ∈ P such that k ≤ j and it is either the case that x k covers x j+1 or x k covers x j+1 in P . As π(x k,r k ) ∈ Q j , we will try to embed one of its neighbors and thus grow Q j . We break the process into two cases depending on π(V j,r k ) ∩ F .</p><p>3.1. If π(V j,r k ) ∩ F = ∅ then we denote by x j+1,r j+1 the first element under ≺ 2 contained in π(V j,r k ) ∩ F . We let Q j+1 := Q j ∪ {π(x j+1,r j+1 )} and we return to Step 3 with Q j+1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_37" coords="11,74.88,254.63,474.76,27.42">3.2. If π(V j,r k ) ∩ F = ∅ then we let H i+1 := H i ∪ Q j and G i+1 := G i \ (π(V j,r k ) ∪ Q j ). We begin iteration i + 1 with (H i+1 , G i+1 ).</formula><p>Note, as F is P -free, Step 1 or Step 3.2 must occur once the above embedding procedure begins. Thus the embedding procedure, and consequently the algorithm, will eventually terminate for some pair (H, G) such that G is P (x, t)-free. As H 0 = ∅, and for all i, we only add elements to H i if they belong to F , hence we have H ⊆ F . Furthermore, as F ⊆ G 0 , and for all i, the elements we remove from G i are always disjoint from F or also added to H i , we have H ⊆ F ⊆ H ∪ G. Thus (i) holds.</p><p>For all i, if at least one element was added to H i , i.e., if Step 3.2 occurs, then we also remove at least t elements from G i . In particular, we have |H| ≤ |P ||S|/t and (ii) holds as well.</p><p>Let F and F ′ be two distinct P -free set systems such that the algorithm outputs (H, G) under input F and outputs (H ′ , G ′ ) under input F ′ . Suppose for the sake of a contradiction, that there exists (H, G), (H ′ , G ′ ) ∈ C with H = H ′ and G = G ′ . Then, there are two distinct P -free set systems F and F ′ such that each returns (H, G) and (H ′ , G ′ ) when applying the algorithm. Since the algorithm is deterministic and G = G ′ , the algorithm at some iteration i, removes an element from G i but not from G ′ i . Suppose this happens at Step 1 of the embedding procedure. Without loss of generality, suppose π(x 1,1 ) ∈ F and π(x 1,1 ) ∈ F ′ . This would imply π(x 1,1 ) ∈ H ′ . As H ⊆ F , we have H = H ′ , a contradiction. If this occurs with Step 3.2, by a similar argument, we obtain a contradiction. Thus we may conclude that (iii) holds, and consequently, the lemma holds as well.

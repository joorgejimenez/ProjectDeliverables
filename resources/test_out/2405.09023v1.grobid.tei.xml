<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The emergence of the branded recommerce channel -digitally enabled and branded marketplaces that facilitate purchasing pre-owned items directly from a manufacturer's e-commerce site -leads to new variants of classic IS and economic questions relating to secondary markets. Such branded recommerce is increasingly platform-enabled, creating opportunities for greater sustainability and stronger brand experience control but posing a greater risk of cannibalization of the sales of new items. We model the effects that the sales of pre-owned items have on market segmentation and product durability choices for a monopolist facing heterogeneous customers, contrasting outcomes when the trade of pre-owned goods takes place through a third-party marketplace with outcomes under branded recommerce. We show that the direct revenue benefits of branded recommerce are not their primary source of value to the monopolist, and rather, there are three indirect effects that alter profits and sustainability. Product durability increases, a seller finds it optimal to forgo marketplace fees altogether, and there are greater seller incentives to lower the quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items. We establish these results for a simple two-period model as well as developing a new infinite horizon model with overlapping generations. Our paper sheds new insight into this emerging digital channel phenomenon, underscoring the importance of recommerce platforms in aligning seller profits with sustainability goals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The market for pre-owned items has seen a significant growth and acceleration of digital innovation over the last few years. Third-party digital markets such as Depop, Poshmark, StockX, and The RealReal have contributed to this recent explosion of "recommerce" -the sale or trading of preowned items. In parallel, new digital platforms like Trove and Recurate have made it possible for companies ranging from Canada Goose and Patagonia to Zara and lululemon to set up their own branded marketplaces that facilitate purchasing pre-owned items directly from the brand, a practice we refer to as branded recommerce. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,272.78,252.09,5.37,10.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents examples of two branded recommerce sites.</p><p>Sales of pre-owned apparel, over $100 billion globally in 2022, are projected to grow at five times the rate of overall commerce, doubling to $218 billion by 2026 and making up 23% of apparel retail sales <ref type="bibr" coords="2,97.15,325.97,75.12,10.96">(Thredup, 2022)</ref>. The emergence of platform-based branded recommerce leads to new variants of classic economics and IS questions relating to secondary markets. For example, manufacturers who see branded recommerce as an opportunity to shape the initial brand experience of customers who begin their brand relationship by buying a pre-owned item have to weigh these benefits against the possible increased threat of cannibalization of the sales of new items. A manufacturer who may not have previously encouraged the purchasing of pre-owned items may find their economic incentives are altered by the prospect of value capture from these transactions under branded recommerce, or may see branded recommerce as an "entry deterring" move against specialty third-party marketplaces for pre-owned items. The ability to capture value from recommerce may increase the incentives of a manufacturer to create more durable products better aligned with sustainability goals.</p><p>In this paper, our focus is on the interplay of some of these factors with a brand's choice of product durability. Intuitively, a more durable product can be used (and reused) more. A higher potential level of reusability can be thought of as being more sustaiable. As an expert on sustainable fashion recently observed in a Bloomberg article <ref type="bibr" coords="3,265.36,283.09,68.55,10.96" target="#b44">(Woody (2024)</ref>):</p><p>"Durability and reparability affect environmental impact," says Veronica Bates Kassatly, a Londonbased fashion industry analyst focused on sustainability. She cites the example of wearing a shirt 500 times. If a cheaply made shirt is replaced after being worn 10 times, 50 shirts will need to be produced and discarded. But if one better-made and easily mended shirt can be worn 500 times, the environmental cost is significantly lower, even if making the garment uses more water and energy upfront.</p><p>A tradeoff for a brand considering this kind of move towards sustainability stems from the threat of cannibalizing the sales of new products; products that degrade faster help drive more frequent replacement or sales of new products. Perhaps the emergence of a channel that allows a brand to internalize some of the value created by resale alters this tradeoff.</p><p>We develop an economic model of recommerce that sheds light on some of these issues. We begin by examining the effects that the sales of pre-owned items have on market segmentation and product durability choices in a two-period model, contrasting outcomes when the trade of pre-owned goods takes place through a third-party marketplace with outcomes under branded recommerce. Our model includes stylized measures that capture third-party market power (the extent to which value from preowned goods trade is captured by the marketplace owner) and quality uncertainty (the gap between the valuation of a pre-owned item by the original owner who knows its actual quality and condition, and a potential buyer who does not). We then extend this analysis to a more general infinte-horizon model in which there are overlapping generations of customers.</p><p>Our results show that under fairly general assumptions, adopting branded recommerce is profitable for a monopolist who faces a third-party secondary marketplace. Furthermore, the monopolist's profit-maximizing durability choices are more aligned with sustainability goals under branded recommerce. We show how this "sustainability bump" from branded recommerce is higher when third-party markets are more powerful, and when pre-owned product quality uncertainty is higher, even though the move to branded recommerce by itself may not resolve any of the underlying quality uncertainty.</p><p>Counterintuitively, the direct revenue potential of branded recommerce is not its equilibrium source of value. Rather, we demonstrate a set of indirect economic effects which benefit manufacturers and increase sustainability. Product durability increases, there are greater seller incentives to invest in lowering the quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items, and it is actually optimal for manufacturers to forgo marketplace fees altogether.</p></div>

(2023)</ref>) may lead to further insight, and this represents a direction for future researchers.</p><p>Our paper is also related to the literature on the incentives of monopoly sellers of durable goods that stems from the celebrated Coase conjecture <ref type="bibr" coords="5,279.34,257.66,64.31,10.96" target="#b9">(Coase (1972)</ref>) -that absent commitment devices, the price charged by a durable goods monopolist is driven down to marginal cost by a time inconsistency problem, thus leading to monopoly choices of durability that are lower than the socially optimal levels, and, as shown by earlier work <ref type="bibr" coords="5,246.28,333.94,143.60,10.96" target="#b22">(Levhari and Srinivasan (1969)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,398.01,333.94,89.36,10.96" target="#b35">Schmalensee (1970)</ref>), inducing a monopolist to pursue a strategy of planned obsolescence. A series of papers that followed have either reinforced and refuted the Coase conjecture. For example, in a series of papers, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,478.83,384.79,56.49,10.96" target="#b39">Swan (1970)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,72.00,410.21,57.07,10.96" target="#b40">Swan (1971)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,137.97,410.21,58.76,10.96" target="#b41">Swan (1972)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="5,222.46,410.21,113.41,10.96" target="#b36">Sieper and Swan (1973)</ref> assert using a model that endogenizes the monopolist's choice of durability that this will actually be at the socially optimal level. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,72.00,461.06,60.41,10.96" target="#b6">Bulow (1982)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,140.05,461.06,62.12,10.96" target="#b7">Bulow (1986)</ref> reaffirms the Coase results, strengthening the theoretical case for leasing and planned obsolescence. While we do not aim to exhaustively summarize this literature, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that connects the ownership of the secondary market to this discussion on optimal durability.</p><p>Our model with overlapping generations of consumers aims to capture the effect of evolving consumer preferences that <ref type="bibr" coords="5,183.31,588.18,72.15,10.96" target="#b20">Johnson (2011)</ref> and others like <ref type="bibr" coords="5,333.45,588.18,86.46,10.96" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2013)</ref> and Fraiberger and Sundararajan (2017) models as idiosyncratic preference shocks. Our approach follows a standard infinite horizon setting in which consumers live for two periods (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" coords="5,412.20,639.03,83.33,10.96" target="#b42">Villas-Boas (2004)</ref>). Rather than incorporating explicitly changing preferences like some of the prior work on secondary markets, in our model, changes in the "age" of a consumer alter their preferences because their horizon is different (two periods versus one).</p><p>Fundamentally, our paper addresses a variant of the central question in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,435.37,79.69,89.05,10.96" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2013)</ref> whether secondary markets help or hurt producers -albeit with a focus specifically on the marketplace ownership choice (recommerce versus third-party). While simpler, our model captures elements of all three key effects of this literature -the substitution effect (pre-owned items may cannibalize new product sales), the allocative effect (sellers indirectly earn higher rents from higher valuation and forward-looking customers if these customers can sell their products in the future), and aspects of the time consistency effect (this increase in willingness to pay of the higher valuation consumers is affected by their future price expectations, which in turn are shaped by the seller's output choices, and the seller does not have the ability to commit to future prices).</p><p>More saliently, our paper adds to an extensive literature in economics, marketing and information systems on secondary markets (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" coords="6,309.81,323.68,92.25,10.96" target="#b2">Bapna et al.

Over the last decade, while true sharing economy platforms that facilitate product sharing and reuse have promised to lead to more sustainable and circular usage, behavior changes that lead to widespread durable goods renting and sharing has been limited outside of the automobile sector. Meanwhile, the trade of pre-owned items has exploded, leading us to believe that perhaps the real impact of platforms on sustainable consumption will come not from sharing but from the digital trade and consumption of pre-owned items. Our efforts to provide a more robust theoretical basis for the ownership structure and economic factors that aid or abet this evolution is aligned with this belief.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Overview of Model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Firm and customers</head><p>We model a monopoly seller whose products last 2 periods. We begin with a two-period world, and then extend it to an infinite period model with overlapping generations. In the first period, the seller chooses how much durability D to build into its products. This choice is fixed across both periods.</p><p>1 The firm bears a constant marginal cost of production c(D) and no fixed costs. We assume that the function c(D) is positive, increasing and strictly convex for all D &gt; 0, and thus c ′ (0) = 0, c ′ (D) &gt; 0, c ′′ (D) &gt; 0 for all D &gt; 0. We also assume that c(0) = 0.</p><p>New products are of a fixed quality level that is normalized to 1. In the second period, units that are 1 period old are of quality s(D), where s(0) = 0, s(D) &lt; 1 for all D, s ′ (D) &gt; 0, s ′′ (D) &lt; 0 for all D ≥ 0. Put simply, the more durable a product, the higher its value as a pre-owned item.</p><p>Customers are heterogeneous, indexed by type j = L, H. Each consumer lives 2 periods. There are n j identical customers of type j. To ensure that the trade of pre-owned goods actually occurs in what follows, we assume that n L &gt; n H . In each period, type-H customers derive a gross benefit v H s from consumption of one unit of good of quality s, while the corresponding gross benefit derived by the low valuation customers is v L s, v H &gt; v L &gt; 0. Customers use either zero units or one unit of the seller's output in each period. The firm and customers discount the future using the discount factor δ, 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Interaction Between the Firm and its Customers</head><p>We assume that the firm cannot explicitly distinguish between consumer types. 2 The firm offers one product in each period. Consumers in the second period may also have the option of buying a preowned item. Thus, in the second period, the firm faces a design problem analogous to one faced by a multiproduct monopolist, but where the quality level of the inferior version in period 2 is determined by the durability choice made in period 1 and whether the secondary market is run by a third party (more on this later).</p><p>The sequence of interaction between the firm and its customers is as follows:</p><p>1 We have also analyzed the case where the firm makes a separate durability choice in each period. It is of comparable analytical complexity. Since there is no "next period" in the second period, this artificially distorts durability downwards. Further, in practice, it may not be realistic to imagine a firm continuously varying its durability, either for technological reasons, or because of brand perception concerns.</p><p>2 Thus, we ignore the customer recognition information the firm may have in the second period from the choices consumers make in the first period (Villas-Boas ( <ref type="formula" coords="7,270.97,715.15,15.87,7.92">2004</ref>)).</p><p>• Period 1: The firm first announces a durability choice D, and the price for a new unit of output p N 1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A two-period model</head><p>We analyze the two-period model in some detail in what follows, since many of the expressions and results from this analysis carry over to the model with overlapping generations. The following situation -which we refer to as the active pre-owned marketplace case -is the one of interest in our analysis, since it is what leads to activity in the marketplace for pre-owned items:</p><p>• Period 1: Consumers of type-H purchase a new product from the firm.</p><p>• Period 2: Consumers of type-H purchase a new product from the firm, selling their pre-owned products in the secondhand marketplace, and consumers of type-L purchase a pre-owned product.</p><p>It is straightforward to show that this case leads to higher firm profits than any case under which the firm's choices lead to type-H consumers wanting to keep their goods in the second period rather than selling them in the secondhand marketplace. This is because the profits from the latter,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="9,72.00,311.68,125.06,11.22">n H [v H (1 + δs(D)) − c(D)],</formula><p>are strictly less than the profits (1 + δ)n H v H that the firm could earn from offering a product of durability zero in each period priced at v H . There is yet another possibility -that the firm chooses a strategy that induces type-L consumers to purchase new goods in one or both periods. However, under any strategy of this kind, there will be no trade in the secondhand marketplace: if type-L consumers purchase a new good in period 1, there is no difference between the pre-owned goods being offered for sale and the ones they hold in period 2 as a consequence of their period 1 purchase, and if type-L consumers do not purchase pre-owned goods in period 2 , there are no potential buyers for any pre-owned goods being offered for sale in period 2. We examine this in greater detail in our overlapping generations model in Section 4 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Contrasting branded recommerce with third-party pre-owned markets</head><p>We now turn to analyzing how the possibility of branded recommerce changes a firm's choices. First, we examine how the pre-owned marketplace commissions and quality uncertainty distort the durability choices of the seller, independent of who runs the pre-owned marketplace. Next, we establish how branded recommerce leads to more sustainable choices by inducing an increase in the durability of products (and as a consequence, the quality of pre-owned goods) and separate out three different drivers of this increase.</p><p>Proposition 1. Independent of whether the seller or a third-party operates the pre-owned marketplace:</p><p>(a) As quality uncertainty goes down (and thus, α increases), the optimal level of durability D * chosen by the seller increases, and the seller profit increases.</p><p>(b) As the commission β charged by the operator of the pre-owned marketplace increases, the optimal level of durability D * chosen by the seller decreases, and the seller profit decreases.</p><p>The proof of the proposition is provided in Appendix. Proposition 1 indicates that the emergence of robust third-party pre-owned marketplace can have countervailing effects on a seller's sustainability incentives. On the one hand, the emergence of a pre-owned marketplace where none existed in the past has a strictly positive effect on the durability, raising it above the baseline level of 0 in our model 5 . However, an increase in the power of a third-party marketplace operator (leading to an increase in the commission rate ) lowers the seller's incentives to create a more durable (and thus sustainable) product.</p><p>We now show how these potentially countervailing incentives are all aligned when the firm runs its own pre-owned marketplace.</p><p>5 One might ask whether we are ignoring, in the absence of a pre-owned marketplace, the possibility of the seller creating a product with positive durability aimed at getting higher type consumers to purchase the product and hold it for 2 periods. This option is strictly dominated by the options of offering a product of durability 0 in both periods, priced at vH .</p><p>Proposition 2. Relative to the case of a third-party pre-owned marketplace, under the case of branded recommerce:</p><p>(a) Optimal durability is higher at any third-party commission rate β and quality uncertainty α.</p><p>(b) The seller will choose a commission rate β = 0.</p><p>(c) The incentives of a seller to invest in reducing quality uncertainty α are higher.</p><p>Proposition 2 establishes a main result -that branded recommerce has a direct effect of inducing higher durability, or put differently, increases the incentives of a firm that makes something to design it to last longer. It also proves a set of indirect economic effects which benefit manufacturers and increase sustainability. Part (b) shows that it is optimal for manufacturers to forgo marketplace fees altogether. Counterintuitively, therefore, the direct revenue potential of branded recommerce is not its equilibrium source of value. Part (c) shows that there are greater seller incentives to invest in lowering the quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items. The "branding" of recommerce by itself may reduce quality uncertainty -after all, a customer is buying the pre-owned item directly from the manufacturer rather than from an unknown individual. However, a key implication of part (a) of the proposition is that the welfare gains of branded recommerce from an increase in durability do not have to assume any change in perceived quality, and the incentive to lower quality uncertainty is a separate positive economic effect. In what follows, we examine whether the insights gained from our two-period model carry over to a more general setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">A model with overlapping generations</head><p>In this section, we develop a model of infinitely many periods in which a fixed number of customers enter in each period, and each generation of customers lives for two periods. We continue to assume that the firm sets a level of durability D that remains fixed across periods. In each period t, the seller chooses its price p n (t), bearing a constant marginal cost of production c(D) that is positive, increasing and strictly convex for all D &gt; 0. Products last two periods. In each period t, new units of output are of a fixed quality level that is normalized to 1 , and pre-owned units (those produced in period t-1) are of quality s(D), where, as before, s(0) = 0, s(D) &lt; 1, s ′ (D) &gt; 0, s ′′ (D) &lt; 0 for all D ≥ 0. The price of pre-owned items in period t is p u (t).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2 An Illustration of the overlapping generation model</head><p>Note. It illustrates the overlapping of generations in each period. In period t, the prior generation that was born in period (t -1) is of age 2, and the new generation that is born in period t is of age 1. In every period, the seller thus faces both "legacy" customers and "fresh" customers.</p><p>As before, the fraction of type-H (L) customers that enter in each period is n H (n L ), where n H + n L = 1. Type-H customers derive a gross benefit per period of v H s from consuming a good of perceived quality s, while the corresponding gross benefit derived by type-L customers is v L s, and v H &gt; v L &gt; 0.</p><p>In any "current" period, the customers who entered in the previous period are referred to as "age-2" customers, and those customers who enter in the current period are referred to as "age-1" customers.</p><p>Customers and sellers discount the future at the rate δ.</p><p>The payoff-relevant state variable x(t) for period t is the fraction of age-2 customers who bought the new product in the previous period t − 1. We focus on deterministic consumer and seller choices.</p><p>As before, the seller cannot observe customer types, which means that if type-L customers purchase in any period, then so do type-H customers. Thus, the possible states are x(t) ∈ {0, n H , 1}.</p><p>Following the standard Blackwell/Bellman approach, we look for a stationary policy which maps each state {0, n H , 1} to a period price p n (t) for the new good. We begin with the case of D = 0. The state will always be x = 0, and the seller's choices here are therefore to price the product at either v L or v H . Thus,the optimal steady-state policy will be to price at v L if v L &gt; n H v H and at v H otherwise. Now consider D &gt; 0. In each period apart from the first period, the seller faces a setting somewhat similar to what was faced in period 2 of the two-period model. However, there are, essentially, four types of customers rather than two -age-1 type-L, age-1 type-H, age-2 type-L and age-2 type-H.</p><p>However, if this is in fact a steady-state, then both type-L and type-H customers of age-2 already own a pre-owned item. As a consequence, there are no potential buyers for the pre-owned items in any period. The profit-maximizing price that sustains this steady-state is v L (1 + δs(D)) which yields a demand level of 1 in each period. Following an argument similar to one made in Section 4, the profit stream from this price is strictly lower than the profit stream from a choice of D = 0 and a price v L which yields a demand level of 2 in each period. This completes the proof.</p><p>Next, let us consider the set of consumer actions that are consistent with a steady-state policy. We show in our next result that under any steady-state policy in which there is any kind of pre-owned market activity, customers with lower willingness to pay will always buy pre-owned items while the choices of customers with higher willingness to pay depends on their decision horizon.</p><p>Lemma 4. Under any steady-state policy</p><p>• All customers with lower willingness-to-pay (type-L customer) will purchase a pre-owned item that lasts one period.</p><p>• Customers with a higher willingess-to-pay who have just entered the market (Type-H, age 1) will buy a new product</p><p>• Customers with a higher willingess-to-pay who were in the market in the previous period (Type-H, age 2) will sell their existing product and buy a new product Again, rather than relegating this proof to the Appendix, we present it in the main body of the paper because it aids in understanding the implications of the result.</p><p>First, to maintain the steady-state x = n H , it is clear that type-H customers of age-1 must choose to buy new. The choices of type-H customers of age 2 can be partitioned as follows:</p><p>• If type-H customers of age-2 discard their existing product and buy new, the steady-state then involves type-L customers not participating, and type-H customers consuming their product for one period. In this case, any durability level D &gt; 0 is strictly less profitable for the seller than the choice of D = 0.</p><p>• If type-H customers of age 2 keep their existing product, then the steady-state again involves type-L customers not participating, and type-H customers consuming their product for both periods of their life. The profit-maximizing price that sustains this steady-state is v H (1 + δs(D))</p><p>which yields a demand level of n H per period. However, this is strictly less profitable for the seller than choosing a durability D = 0, pricing at v H , and realizing a demand of 2n H (from both all type-H customers).</p><p>• If type-H customers of age 2 sell their existing product and buy a new product, then one must characterize the choices of type-L customers (since someone has to buy these products). Since the product lasts 2 periods, a pre-owned product has a remaining life of 1 period. As a consequence, its value is identical to both age 1 and age 2 customers of type-L.</p><p>-The steady-state cannot be maintained if type-L customers of age 1 prefer to buy the new product.</p><p>-The steady-state can be maintained if type-L customers of age 2 prefer to buy the new product at whatever price levels the new and pre-owned products are at (since they are no longer in the economy after the current period, their choices do not affect the state in the next period), while type-L customers of age 1 prefer to purchase the pre-owned product.</p><p>However, since type-L customers of age 1 have an additional period of life and thus have a strictly higher consumption value from the new product, which in turn means that the set of actions (type-L customers of age 2 buy new, type-L customers of age 1 buy pre-owned)</p><p>is not individually rational.</p><p>-The steady state can also be maintained if type-L customers of both age 1 and age 2 prefer to buy the used product over buying the new product.

Granted, sellers may be drawn to branded recommerce by the prospect of greater control of the customer experience for those buyers who begin their brand interaction by purchasing pre-owned items, or by the promise of profits from secondary market transactions. Our result establishes that there is a path to greater profits from sacrificing the latter, and that in addition to whatever firm-specific benefits that may accrue from branded recommerce, it shifts incentives in a manner that makes it more desirable for a seller to make goods that last longer, rather than resorting to the less sustainable path of more perishable durables in pursuit of repeat sales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The promise of digitally-enabled branded recommerce is clear to a brand -running one's own pre-owned marketplace allows value capture from the trade of one's used items, signals support</p><p>for circular consumption and allows stronger brand experience control for the growing subset of consumers who favor buying pre-owned items. Brands, however, may initially balk at the prospect of placing pre-owned items aside new products on their ecommerce sites, fearing profit reductions from cannibalization.</p><p>Our analysis presents reassuring news: that branded recommerce has a number of positive effects on both durability and profitability. Interestingly, we find that a brand's focus should not be on the value capture promise of branded recommerce -in our stylized setting, a seller finds it optimal to forgo marketplace fees altogether, suggesting that direct revenue impacts of branded recommerce should not be seen as their primary economic benefit. Rather, we uncover more subtle benefits that stem from the ability to set higher prices, the ability to profitably raise product durability, and greater seller incentives to lower quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items.</p><p>While formal empirical validation of our theoretical results remains in the future, it has been reassuring to observe anecdotal evidence of a relationship between the adoption of branded recommerce and investments into raising product durability. For example, Patagonia, which pioneered its "Worn</p><p>Wear" effort to sell pre-owned items in stores in 2013, and was of the early adopters of branded recommerce in 2017, has since made significant efforts to increase the durability and reusability of the products it manufactures <ref type="bibr" coords="22,211.91,105.12,68.55,10.96" target="#b44">(Woody (2024)</ref>).</p><p>Our future work aims to extend our model in a few directions. We are working on an extension that considers the potential simultaneous presence of branded recommerce and a third-party marketplace.</p><p>Our preliminary findings suggest that under certain conditions, the threat of a third-party marketplace can cause a firm to introduce branded recommerce in settings under which it would not have customarily encouraged the trade of pre-owned items -this move can deter the entry of a third-party marketplace that would have a more adverse effect on seller outcomes. Our model extension in which the two pre-owned marketplace options are differentiated by both quality uncertainty and product availability is in progress, but is one we hope will take us closer to having richer testable results.</p><p>We are also exploring extensions to the baseline model that add additional details that reflect what we have observed in practice. For example, in the implementation of recommerce, there may be differing levels of search frictions <ref type="bibr" coords="22,246.72,384.79,131.84,10.96" target="#b13">(Gavazza and Lizzeri (2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="22,387.35,384.79,96.18,10.96" target="#b34">Rhodes et al. (2021)</ref>) associated with the pre-owned item when compared to new items, depending on whether the pre-owned item is listed alongside the new item (like it is on Amazon), in a separate tab on the brand's primary ecommerce site (like it is on Lululemon), or on an entirely different web site. While we currently model this as being subsumed by the reduction in perceived value, a more detailed model could shed new insight and lead to testable hypotheses, given the variations in these frictions we have observed across recommerce sites. The choices on these front may also have quality signaling implications <ref type="bibr" coords="22,492.81,537.33,47.19,10.96;22,72.00,562.76,94.80,10.96" target="#b28">(Nian and Sundararajan (2022)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="22,174.99,562.76,139.34,10.96" target="#b0">Ananthakrishnan et al.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_0">This may seem like a somewhat unusual socially optimal benchmark. However, it is the one that is meaningful in our context. In contrast, if we consider the situation under which both consumer types consumed a new good in each period, durability is irrelevant, and the optimal level of durability is zero. To motivate this benchmark, imagine that the seller can identify types, creates a single period rental contract for the new good offered to type-H in each period,</note>

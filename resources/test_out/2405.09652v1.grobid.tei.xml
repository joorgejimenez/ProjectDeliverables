<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The space Hom(Z k , G) of ordered commuting k-tuples in a Lie group G has been studied in various settings such as geometry, homotopy theory and mathematical physics -in large part because Hom(Z k , G) may be identified with the space of flat G-bundles over a rank k-torus. From the point of view of physics, the case of interest is when G is a compact Lie group, and from the homotopical point of view this may be justified by a remarkable result from A. Pettet and J. Souto <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.00,426.93,15.48,9.96" target="#b10">[11]</ref> which states that for the group of complex or real points of a reductive algebraic group G (defined over R in the latter case), the inclusion K ֒→ G of its maximal compact subgroup induces a deformation retraction Hom(Z k , G) ≃ Hom(Z k , K). However, there are many Lie groups which are not algebraic where such a homotopy equivalence is far from achievable. For instance, W. Goldman <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.00,474.69,10.56,9.96" target="#b7">[8]</ref> studied the space of commuting pairs in H 3 (R), the reduced Heisenberg group over R, and showed that Hom(Z 2 , H 3 (R)) has an infinite number of path-connected components, whereas the space of commuting pairs in S 1 ⊂ H 3 (R) is path-connected. Moreover, Goldman shows that at the level of path-connected components, the map that forgets the flat connection</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="1,200.04,532.01,211.80,12.61">π 0 (Hom(Z k , G)) → [BZ k , BG] = H 2 (Z k ; π 1 (G)) ,</formula><p>specialized to G = H 3 (R) and k = 2, is bijective. In this paper we will use this map to analyze the homotopy type of Hom(Z k , G) for connected nilpotent Lie groups, but from the Lie algebra perspective which is viable under these assumptions.</p><p>For a large class of nilpotent groups, we obtain a description of Hom(Z k , G) in terms of Stiefel manifolds and its maximal compact subgroup. Consider the group of n × n upper unitriangular matrices U n (F) over F, where F = R or C. We let A ⊂ U n (F) denote the standard central subgroup isomorphic to Z in the real case and to Z × Z in the complex case. Then we define the reduced group of n × n upper unitriangular matrices as U n (F) := U n (F)/A .</p><p>For n ≥ 2, the maximal compact subgroup K ⊂ U n (F) is in all real cases the central subgroup S 1 and in all complex cases the central subgroup S 1 × S 1 . In particular the space of commuting k-tuples of K is path-connected for every k ≥ 1. The situation for the ambient groups is quite different. Our first result concerns a complete identification of the homotopy type of Hom(Z k , U n (F)). For convenience we set D(R) := C and D(C) := H (the quaternions), so that we have a unified way to refer to them as D(F) -here D stands for the Cayley-Dickson doubling construction.</p><p>Theorem 1. Let k, n ≥ 1, and F = R or C. Then the map that forgets the flat structure at the level of path-connected components π 0 (Hom(Z k , U n+2 (F)) → H 2 (Z k ; A) is injective for every k ≥ 2, and surjective if and only if k 2 ≤ n. Moreover, each component parametrized by a class β ∈ H 2 (Z k ; A) is homotopy equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,250.80,231.29,110.40,12.61">V r (D(F) n ) × (S 1 ) k dim R F ,</formula><p>where 2r = rank(β).</p><p>Here V q (D(F) m ) as usual stands for the Stiefel manifold of q-frames in D(F) m , and we think of a cohomology class β as an antisymmetric bilinear form over F k where rank(β) is the rank of its associated matrix with respect to the canonical basis of F k .</p><p>The generalized Heisenberg groups H 2n+1 (F), of dimension 2n+1 over F, are naturally subgroups of U n+2 (F) that contain the center, so we analogously define the reduced generalized Heisenberg group of dimension 2n + 1 as H 2n+1 (F) := H 2n+1 (F)/A .</p><p>Our theorem heavily relies on the fact that the inclusion (Proposition 2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,213.72,380.57,184.59,15.01">Hom(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)) ≃ ֒− → Hom(Z k , U n+2 (F))</formula><p>admits a deformation retraction. Then we show that, up to homotopy, the path-connected components of Hom(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)) correspond to symplectic frames of (F 2n , ω n ) where ω n is the symplectic form that determines H 2n+1 (F). In Subsection 3.3 we give an interesting application of Theorem 1 to classifying spaces for commutativity. We exhibit a connected Lie group G (infinite dimensional) whose looped commutator map splits, up to homotopy. Our approach to understand the homotopy type of commuting elements in a connected nilpotent Lie group G is via almost commuting elements in its Lie algebra g. These spaces are related by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula (see Proposition 1 for a precise statement). When G is simplyconnected and nilpotent we obtain that Hom(Z k , G) is contractible (Corollary 1), and hence it has the same homotopy type of the space of commuting elements in its maximal compact subgroup K = {1}, the trivial subgroup. If G is connected and nilpotent but with non-trivial π 1 (G), a deformation retraction to the subspace of commuting elements in its maximal compact subgroup may or may not exist depending on a condition on π 1 (G), when regarded as a discrete subgroup of the center of the Lie algebra Z(g), namely π 1 (G) ∼ = ker(exp | Z(g) ). We merge our results in Corollary 3 and Corollary 4 into the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2. Let G be a connected nilpotent Lie group and K ⊂ G a maximal compact subgroup. Then the inclusion Hom(Z k , K) ֒→ Hom(Z k , G) admits a deformation retraction if and only if no non-trivial element in π 1 (G) corresponds to a Lie bracket under the isomorphism</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,90.00,612.95,431.94,25.87">π 1 (G) ∼ = ker(exp | Z(g) ).</formula><p>As it is well known, for non-compact Lie groups G, the space of isomorphism classes of representations Rep(Z k , G) = Hom(Z k , G)/G in general does not behave nicely from the topological point of view, as it may not even be a T 1 -space. However, Theorem 1 still gives a full account on the indexing set of path-connected components for Rep(Z k , U n+2 (F)) by a standard argument of injective composites (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.28,694.53,51.80,9.96">Corollary 5)</ref>.</p><p>For H 2n+1 (F) we describe in detail, what comes into place when modding out by the conjugation action. For instance, it turns out the the representation space Rep(Z 2 , H 2n+1 (F)) contains the socalled irrational tori (see Example 1). It is not hard to believe then, that from the homotopical point of view, studying these moduli spaces as they stand may not be achievable. As an alternative, we compute the maximal Hausdorff quotient which we denote by Rep(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)) T2 , and show that the path-connected components parametrized by a form β ∈ H 2 (Z k , A) coincide with its maximal Hausdorff subspaces</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,238.44,175.61,135.06,12.49">{f ∈ Hom(F k , F 2n ) | f * ω n = β}</formula><p>(which have the homotopy type of V r (D(F) n ), where r = rank(β)), except for the path-connected component of the trivial representation, which up to homotopy is simply (S 1 ) k dim R F .</p><p>In the last part of the paper, from an independent interest, we study the space of 2n × k matrices whose columns span an isotropic subspace of F 2n with respect to the standard symplectic form. In our notation this space corresponds to X(k, n, 0). Our motivation is that X(k, n, 0) is very closely related to Hom(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)) 1 . We consider the filtration of X(k, n, 0) induced by the rank of a matrix. We found particularly interesting that the aforementioned filtration still carries homotopical information regarding the full space Hom(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)), at least up to a fiber sequence. We denote the strata of the rank filtration by X(k, n, 0) d , and then we have a smooth fiber bundle</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="3,254.88,312.29,102.27,12.49">X(k, n, 0) d → Gr(d, F k )</formula><p>with fibers the space of linear isotropic embeddings F d → F 2n , which we denote by Iso(2n, d, F). We show that Iso(2n, d, F) is homotopy equivalent to the Stiefel manifold V d (D(F) n ). The main result of this last section is a homotopy stable splitting of the strata X(k, n, 0) d into a wedge of Thom spaces following Crabb and Gonçalves <ref type="bibr" coords="3,259.68,371.97,9.90,9.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The splitting is depicted in Theorem 5.</p><p>We start with some structural results for commuting elements in connected nilpotent Lie groups, which are completely deducted from almost commuting elements in its Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket.</p></div>

We already know that [exp(x), exp(y)] = exp([x, y] + z) where z is a finite combination of nested brackets in x and y, each of them of length at least 3, and by Lemma 1 it follows that [x, y] + z ∈ A. We now proceed similarly as in the proof of Lemma 1: let L := x, y be the Lie subalgebra of g generated by x and y. Applying the operators [x, −] and [y, −] to [x, y] + z we obtain that [x, [x, y]] and [y,</p><formula xml:id="formula_23" coords="6,90.00,234.57,432.00,21.96">[x, y]] are in [L, [L, [L, L]]]], so that [L, [L, [L, L]]] = [L, [L, L]].</formula><p>As L is nilpotent we further obtain that [L, L] is 2-step nilpotent.

There must be a basis {a 1 , . . . , a m } of A k -here m = k or m = 2k, depending on whether F = R or C-such that the first d elements have integer multiples λ 1 a 1 , . . . , λ d a d which form a basis for P . Then, since for every i = d + 1, . . . , m, since ρ V (a i ) ∈ ρ V (λ 1 a 1 ), . . . , ρ V d a d ) , there is a vector of the form a</p><p>Then we have two types of fibers with respect to p:</p><p>Now the first type of fiber is a Hausdorff space, and the closure of any point in the second type of fiber is the whole fiber. We can now describe the topology of the T 1 -quotient and the maximal Hausdorff quotient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">T 1 -quotient</head><p>We may construct the T 1 -quotient of E(k, n, 2r) by means of identifying points x ∼ y if the intersection of the closure of their A k -orbits O x ∩O y is non-empty in E(k, n, 2r), as long as this identification actually yields a T 1 -space. Running this procedure we see that for any f ∈ X(k, n, 2r) − X(k, n, 2r) Q the whole fiber q −1 (f ) will identify to a single point, as it is an indiscrete topological space. On the other hand if f ∈ X(k, n, 2r) Q , then q −1 (f ) is closed in E(k, n, 2r) so all of its points are closed and will remain unaffected under the identification. We may describe the resulting space as follows. Consider the composite σ 0</p><p>in which the first map is the zero section s 0 (f ) = (f, 0) and the second one is the honest quotient map. Also consider the subspace</p><p>For a topological space X, let us write X T1 for its T 1 -quotient. The resulting space is then the union of these two subspaces</p><p>where the quotient map E(k, n, 2r) → E(k, n, 2r) T1 is the one that collapses all fibers q −1 (f ), with f ∈ X(k, n, 2r) − X(k, n, 2r) Q , to its corresponding point in σ 0 (X(k, n, 2r)).</p><p>Similarly as before, every path connected component of Rep(Z k , H 2n+1 (R)) T1 is homeomorphic to one of E(k, n, 2r) T1 for some 2r ≤ k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">T 2 -quotient</head><p>For a topological space X, let us write X T2 for its maximal Hausdorff quotient. Proposition 8. If r &gt; 0, E(k, n, 2r) T2 = X(k, n, 2r), and E(k, n, 0) T2 = X(k, n, 0) ∨ (S 1 ) τ k , where τ = dim R (F).</p><p>Proof. For q : E(k, n, 2r) → X(k, n, 2r) let q ′ : E(k, n, 2r) T1 → X(k, n, 2r) be the unique map that factors q through the quotient map E(k, n, 2r) → E(k, n, 2r) T1 . Then note that any two points in distinct fibers of q ′ posses disjoint open neighborhoods, but no two points in a single fiber (q ′ ) −1 (f ) have disjoint open neighborhoods, except when f = 0, since (q ′ ) −1 (0) = (S 1 ) τ k . Remark 11. Note that up to homotopy, the T 2 -quotient of Rep(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)) is no different from the space of almost commuting elements B k (h 2n+1 (F), Z)), except at the component of the trivial representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">A filtration of X(k, n, 0) and stable homotopy type of strata</head><p>In this last section, we follow <ref type="bibr" coords="22,219.84,228.93,10.56,9.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to give a homotopy stable decompositions of the space of matrices that span an isotropic subspace of (F 2n , ω n ) of a given rank. The idea is to use Crabb's equivariant version <ref type="bibr" coords="22,123.84,252.81,10.56,9.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> of Miller's stable splitting of Stiefel manifolds <ref type="bibr" coords="22,339.72,252.81,14.59,9.96" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">The filtration by rank</head><p>Recall that we may see the spaces X(k, n, 2r) as matrices 2n × k matrices and hence they can be stratified by rank. Consider that map π : X(k, n, 2r) → {2r, ..., min(k, 2n, n + 2r)} given by π(f ) = dim((ker f ) ⊥ ). This is a continuous map with respect to the poset topology, and yields a poset stratification for X(k, n, 2r). Then for every 2r</p><p>It is clear why d ≤ min(k, 2n), and the extra constraint in the top rank dimension is related to the fact that if d &gt; 2r, the column space of each matrix in X(k, n, 2r) d also contains an isotropic subspace of F 2n with respect to ω n . Now consider the map</p><p>Then we may exhibit a filtration of E(k, n, 2r) by considering the pullback</p><p>We thus have a stratification of both the moduli space</p><p>For completeness, the associated filtrations are</p><p>where each stage of the filtration is given by</p><p>Remark 12. We also have the corresponding orbit spaces E(k, n, 2r) d := E(k, n, 2r) d /A k , which yield a stratification of Rep(Z k , H 2n+1 (F)). For its maximal Hausdorff quotient the d &gt; 0 stratum is E(k, n, 2r) T2 d = X(k, n, 2r) d , and the 0-stratum is</p><p>) τ k where as before τ = dim R (F).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Isotropic isometric frame extends to symplectic isometric frame</head><p>To use Miller's splitting, we need a correspondence between isotropic frames in (F 2n , ω n ) and orthogonal frames in D(F) n . We achieve this by restricting to isotropic frames which are also orthogonal, which we will see are in correspondence with orthogonal symplectic frames.</p><p>Instead of considering matrices such that M T Ω n M = 0, it will be simpler to replace Ω n by the standard symplectic matrix J n , which gives a homeomorphic space of matrices M . So let ν n be the symplectic form on F 2n defined by J n , and for any vector space V over F such that dim(V ) ≤ n, let us denote the space of isotropic embeddings by</p><p>If further V has an inner product we will also consider the subspace of orthogonal isotropic embeddings OrIso(2n, V, F) = {φ ∈ Iso(2n, V, F)) | φ * φ = id} .</p><p>When V = F r we will simply write Iso(2n, r, F) and OrIso(2n, r, F). Now recall that for every vector space V , the product V ⊕ V * is a symplectic space with the standard symplectic form ((x, ξ), (y, η)) → η(x) − ξ(y). We let Sp(2n, V, F) be the space of symplectic embeddings V ⊕ V * → F 2n with respect to the standard symplectic forms. Similarly let OrSp(2n, V, F) be the subspace of orthogonal symplectic embeddings. Lemma 10. Whenever V is an inner vector space over F with dim V ≤ n, the map OrIso(2n, V, F)</p><p>is a diffeomorphism, where we have borrowed the matrix notation on the right hand side to denote the map</p><p>Proof. First we show that (J n φ φ) preserves the standard symplectic form over V ⊕V * . Evaluating we get</p><p>as φ preserves the zero form and orthogonal (hermitian). Since J 2 n = −Id, it follows that (J n φ φ) is isometric. Clearly it is injective. To see that the assignment is surjective, suppose ϕ : V ⊕ V * → F 2n is an isometric symplectic embedding and let us write ϕ = (ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ). Then since ϕ preserves J dim(V ) , a similar calculation as above shows that ϕ 1 = J n ϕ 2 .</p><p>Remark 13. Let O(V ) denote the isometric automorphisms of V . The standard right O(V )action over OrIso(2n, V, F) under the diffeomorphism corresponds to the action of the diagonal</p><p>Lemma 11. The polar decomposition for rectangular matrices restricts to a diffeomorphism OrIso(2n, V, F) × Sym(V )</p><p>where Sym(V ) is the vector space of self adjoint operators of V .</p><p>Proof. Indeed, before restricting to isotropic embeddings, this is a diffeomorphism (see for example [6, Proposition 2.1]). Now, if in a polar decomposition A = U P where A is an isotropic embedding and U has orthonormal columns, it follows that U is an isotropic embedding, as well, since any invertible matrix preserves the zero form.</p><p>Remark 14. We should point out that the non-compact manifolds Iso(2n, 2r, F) and Sp(2n, 2r, F) are not diffeomorphic, even though their respective isometric versions are (Lemma 10). One may verify this for example by computing the dimensions of their respective tangent spaces. Nonetheless, we may use the above polar decomposition (Lemma 11) to extend the map of Lemma 10 to</p><p>which one can verify that it is actually an embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Stable splitting of X(k, n, 0) d</head><p>We are now ready to exhibit the stable splitting, but first we summarize Crabb and Gonçalves construction.</p><p>Miller <ref type="bibr" coords="24,134.16,429.09,15.48,9.96">[10,</ref> Theorem C] proved a stable splitting for the one-point compactification of the space of isometric embeddings between two real, complex or quaternionic vector spaces, and Crabb <ref type="bibr" coords="24,511.44,440.97,10.56,9.96" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="24,90.00,452.97,58.63,9.96">Theorem 1.16</ref>] pointed out that the construction can be done equivariantly with respect to a fairly large symmetry group. Then Crabb and Gonçalves <ref type="bibr" coords="24,318.60,464.85,10.56,9.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref> used this equivariant stable splitting to get a stable splitting for the space of linear maps with kernel of a fixed dimension.</p><p>To state the form of Miller's splitting they used, we need some notation for Thom spaces and a couple of standard representations. For a representation ρ : G → O(W ) and a principal G-bundle P → X, we let X ρ denote the Thom space of the associated vector bundle P × G W → X, namely P × G D(W )/P × G S(W ) where D(W ) and S(W ) denote the unit disk and unit spheres in W . Now let ad m denote the adjoint representation of O(F m ), where we let F also stand for the quaternions and O(H m ) = Sp(m), and let can m be the canonical representation of O(F m ) over Hom(F m , F).</p><p>Miller's stable splitting is a map</p><p>where F s and F m−d are trivial O(F l ) representations. Crabb showed the map is equivariant for a group he denoted Γ(F d , F m−d ), but for what follows we will only need</p><p>Here we won't describe the full symmetry group or its actions, but will only describe the action of O(F d ) × O(F m−d ).</p><p>On the left-hand side it is the obvious action, but on the right it is non-obvious: an element</p><p>where recall that we set D(R) = C and D(C) = H. Therefore, g d is fiberwise homotopy equivalent to the bundle</p><p>In order to apply Miller's splitting for V d (D(F) n ) here, we will need to rewrite this fiber bundle using the non-obvious group action that Crabb used.</p><p>Lemma 12. The following fiber bundles over Gr(d, F k ) are isomorphic:</p><p>where we implicitly extend scalars from F to D(F).</p><p>Proof. The isomorphisms are given by: [(ψ, φ)] → [(η, (1 ⊕ η −1 ) • φ)], and</p><p>where in the first map η ∈ O(F k ) is an arbitrarily chosen extension of ψ : F d → F k to an orthogonal map on all of F k . It is straightforward to check the maps are well-defined, mutually inverse and commute with the projections to the Grassmannian. </p></div>			</div>

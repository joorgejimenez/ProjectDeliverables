<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Most planning of the traditional hydrogen energy supply chain (HSC) focuses on the storage and transportation links between production and consumption ends. It ignores the energy flows and interactions between each link, making it unsuitable for energy system planning analysis. Therefore, we propose the concept of a hydrogen energy chain (HEC) based on the HSC, which emphasizes the interactions between different types of energy flows in the production, compression, storage, transportation, and application links of hydrogen. The HEC plays a crucial role in mitigating fluctuations of renewable energy and facilitating the optimal allocation of heterogeneous energy sources across time and space. Effective collaborative planning models that consider HEC are essential for the optimal configuration of multi-energy systems (MESs), which guarantees high-efficiency operation and the economic and environmental friendliness of the system. This paper presents a systematic review of recent articles on collaborative planning of integrated hydrogen energy chain multi-energy systems (HEC-MESs). First, we introduce the basic framework of HEC-MES, focusing on the current research status of the production, compression, storage, transportation, and application links in HEC. Furthermore, we review technology types of hydrogen energy for planning and summarize the typical forms of HEC in MESs. Then, the following sections outline the models and methods for collaborative planning of HEC-MES. They include detailed analyses of covered sector types, spatial and temporal scopes of planning, uncertainties, model formulations, and solution methods. Finally, the paper concludes by summarizing the research gaps identified in current articles and outlining directions for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the integration of large-scale renewable energy, increasing stochasticity and volatility pose significant challenges to the safety and economy of energy system operation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,420.12,102.75,12.78,11.62" target="#b3">[5]</ref>. Nowadays, the energy system is characterized by an imbalance between the geographical distribution and development of renewable energy resources, a seasonal mismatch between energy supply and demand, and a lack of flexibility <ref type="bibr" coords="3,98.88,164.79,9.00,11.62" target="#b4">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,107.88,164.79,4.50,11.62" target="#b5">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,112.38,164.79,9.00,11.62" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. The construction of multi-energy systems (MESs) has become an effective approach for addressing the above problems and challenges. Compared with traditional energy systems, MESs can realize synergistic multi-energy supply and gradient utilization. Furthermore, it can improve overall flexibility and efficiency while meeting energy demands <ref type="bibr" coords="3,321.60,226.95,12.78,11.62" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Hydrogen energy is considered as a significant carrier for the deep decarbonization of energy systems in the future due to its high combustion value, low carbon emissions, and high flexibility of storage/conversion <ref type="bibr" coords="3,144.36,476.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Electrolysis cells (ECs) can convert surplus wind and solar energy into hydrogen <ref type="bibr" coords="3,96.36,497.19,18.43,11.62" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. According to the IEA forecast, the global electricity used for hydrogen production will exceed 8,000 TWh in 2050, accounting for more than 60% of the energy source for hydrogen production <ref type="bibr" coords="3,103.80,538.59,12.78,11.62">[4]</ref>. Hydrogen energy storage (HS) is a large-scale and long-term form of energy storage <ref type="bibr" coords="3,47.40,559.35,18.43,11.62" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. When combined with hydrogen transportation, it allows for the optimal allocation of energy across geographical and seasonal boundaries. Hydrogen energy can also generate clean electricity and heat using equipment such as hydrogen-fired turbines (HTs) and fuel cells (FCs) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,453.72,600.75,14.62,11.62" target="#b11">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,473.22,600.75,14.62,11.62" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. It can be concluded that hydrogen will play a crucial role in various future application scenarios. With this background, governments worldwide have successively formulated strategic routes for hydrogen energy development and actively promoted hydrogen energy technology research and industrial deployment, among which China <ref type="bibr" coords="3,156.96,683.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, the European Union <ref type="bibr" coords="3,296.04,683.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, the United States <ref type="bibr" coords="3,420.24,683.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, and Japan <ref type="bibr" coords="3,507.00,683.55,20.08,11.62" target="#b16">[18]</ref> are representative. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,155.04,704.19,6.00,11.62" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates representative strategic routes for hydrogen energy development. The global consensus for the development of hydrogen energy is to promote the construction of a complete top-down hydrogen energy industry chain.</p><p>The integration of hydrogen energy contributes to the balance of heterogeneous energy supply and demand, as well as the flexibility enhancement within MESs <ref type="bibr" coords="4,342.96,144.15,18.43,11.62" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. However, there are challenges due to the complex relationship between energy coupling <ref type="bibr" coords="4,335.04,164.79,20.08,11.62" target="#b18">[20]</ref> and multiple spatiotemporal scale characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="4,121.44,185.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. This leads to difficulties in the coordinated operation of different devices and synergistic mutualization of energy flows in MES planning. Traditional planning methods cannot meet the planning needs of multi-energy flow and diversified scenarios, which easily causes planning deviation, high investment costs, and energy resource waste. Collaborative planning between different energy networks and equipment is an effective measure for addressing the above challenges. It can quantitatively depict the differences in the characteristics of different energy flows, accurately describe the dynamics and interactions of equipment, and effectively improve the reliability and economy of the planning results. Recently, researchers have conducted numerous studies to explore collaborative planning methods to enhance the economy, performance, and feasibility of MESs containing hydrogen.</p><p>Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="4,98.76,371.79,20.08,11.62" target="#b20">[22]</ref> studied zero-carbon emission energy systems in Europe and showed that collaborative planning considering ECs and HSs can reduce the hydrogen cost by 10 €/MWh. Peng Hou et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,528.00,392.55,20.08,11.62" target="#b21">[23]</ref> proposed a coupled system combining offshore wind power and hydrogen energy. The authors noted that the utilization of surplus wind energy for hydrogen production through ECs is the optimal investment strategy for maximizing the profit of wind farms. Research <ref type="bibr" coords="4,408.96,454.59,20.08,11.62" target="#b22">[24]</ref> established a hydrogen storage system model considering electric-heat coupling and conducted a collaborative planning analysis of an integrated energy system (IES). This verified that electric-hydrogen-heat conversion contributes to improving energy utilization efficiency.</p><p>To date, many researchers have conducted overviews of a specific type of energy system containing hydrogen (e.g., electricity-gas-hydrogen IESs) and related planning techniques. Reference <ref type="bibr" coords="4,528.00,558.15,19.96,11.62" target="#b23">[25]</ref> provided a comprehensive review of hydrogen-based combined heat and power (CHP) systems, covering equipment technology, hydrogen management, and system design. This review suggested that rational spatial planning can reduce system costs and energy losses. A.Z. Arsad et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,471.96,620.19,20.08,11.62" target="#b24">[26]</ref> provided a detailed review of the issues, difficulties, and challenges of IESs with HSs based on a comprehensive analysis of highly cited papers. Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="4,255.84,661.59,19.96,11.62" target="#b25">[27]</ref> summarized the modeling and scope of the electricitygas-hydrogen energy system planning model based on recent related research and provided an in-depth analysis of the system characteristics and technical features. However, the above reviews analyzed only a single type of energy system and did not investigate complete hydrogen links with diverse energy conversion relationships. Furthermore, study <ref type="bibr" coords="5,272.64,82.11,20.08,11.62" target="#b24">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="5,319.80,82.11,19.96,11.62" target="#b25">[27]</ref> focused more on system-wide overviews without analyzing planning in sufficient depth. Currently, some papers offer an extensive review of hydrogen energy supply chain (HSC) design and planning. Reference <ref type="bibr" coords="5,394.80,123.39,19.96,11.62" target="#b26">[28]</ref> provided a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts, development routes, and construction scenarios of HSCs. It also analyzed the planning models and methods of related infrastructures in a categorized manner. In addition, Fabio Sgarbossa et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,209.88,185.55,20.08,11.62" target="#b27">[29]</ref> spotlighted the HSCs for hydrogen production from renewable power generation and proposed a planning matrix for renewable HSC planning based on a systematic analysis of existing studies. Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="5,242.16,226.95,20.08,11.62" target="#b28">[30]</ref> logically reviewed the research on HSC network design models, provided in-depth analyses and classified summaries around modeling and solution strategies, and pointed out the shortcomings of the existing research and the possible problems of future research.</p><p>However, the above reviews focused on the planning of HSCs, especially on the storage and transportation link between production and consumption ends, which is weakly related to the energy system. They paid little attention to the energy flows and interactions between the various links.</p><p>Therefore, integrating the HSC with the energy system for collaborative planning is not recommended.</p><p>Furthermore, several papers have provided a comprehensive overview of only specific hydrogen energy technologies (e.g., ECs <ref type="bibr" coords="5,161.28,392.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, HSs <ref type="bibr" coords="5,210.24,392.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, and FCs <ref type="bibr" coords="5,279.00,392.55,19.23,11.62" target="#b31">[33]</ref>) and hydrogen energy systems <ref type="bibr" coords="5,451.20,392.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</p><p>To fill the above gap, the hydrogen energy chain (HEC) is proposed based on HSC and focuses on the interactions between energy flows in the production, compression, storage, transportation, and application links of hydrogen. This paper comprehensively reviews recent research on the collaborative planning of integrated hydrogen energy chain multi-energy systems (HEC-MESs), emphasizing the close relationship between HEC and the energy sector. This study aims to analyze the collaborative planning of the HEC with other energy networks and equipment in MESs and to explore the role of coupled hydrogen energy conversion. First, this review explores the basic concepts and typical forms of the HEC integrated into the MES and provides a systematic review of its top-down production, compression, storage, transport, and application aspects. The survey of equipment and its features related to the HECs provides a more comprehensive understanding. Next, it summarizes the general forms of the existing research on collaborative planning models, including their covered sector types (e.g., the electric power and traffic sectors), spatial and temporal scopes of planning, and uncertainties.</p><p>Additionally, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the objective function, the forms of the formulation, and its characteristics, as well as a detailed classification and analysis of the model's solution technologies.

Overall, this article presents a comprehensive review of the research on collaborative planning of HEC-MESs.</p><p>This study provides inspiration for researchers in the field and offers a reference for future low-carbon energy system planning scenarios.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is divided into two main parts (Part 1 includes Sections 2 and 3, and Part 2 includes Sections 4 and 5), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,270.00,144.15,4.50,11.62" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. It is organized as follows: 1.

In Section 6, the paper summarizes the contents of this paper, discusses the limitations of existing research and discusses future guideline directions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Composition of HEC</head><p>HEC typically involves production, compression, storage, transportation, and application, each in a different form. This section focuses on the current development of each link in HEC, the type of technology, and its role in the energy sector. Then, we explain the concept of a complete HEC in a comprehensive top-down manner and analyze the connections between the links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Hydrogen production link</head><p>Hydrogen production is the primary link in HEC and is also a prerequisite for the future large-scale utilization of hydrogen energy. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,257.28,235.59,6.00,11.62" target="#fig_3">3</ref> illustrates the technology categorization of hydrogen production. According to the IEA <ref type="bibr" coords="7,224.88,256.23,18.43,11.62" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, global hydrogen production in 2022 has increased by 3% compared to that in 2021, reaching 95 million tons. However, less than 1% of this is clean hydrogen production. Currently, the majority of hydrogen production relies on fossil energy reforming, with coal gasification and natural gas reforming accounting for 62% and 21%, respectively. Additionally, 16% of hydrogen production comes from industrial by-products such as coke oven gas and chlor-alkali tail gas <ref type="bibr" coords="7,47.40,359.79,18.43,11.62" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. The World Energy Council <ref type="bibr" coords="7,207.84,359.79,19.96,11.62" target="#b34">[36]</ref> categorizes the produced hydrogen based on its carbon emissions, using the colors grey, blue, and green to represent descending levels of emissions. Grey and blue hydrogen are usually distinguished by whether the production link utilizes carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology <ref type="bibr" coords="7,208.44,421.83,18.43,11.62" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. Green hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced with zero-carbon emissions. It is essential to conduct research on large-scale clean hydrogen production technology to achieve decarbonization. Generally, clean hydrogen production technologies can be categorized into direct production from renewable energy and clean electricity electrolysis of water. The former technologies are in the experimental development stage and are not yet suitable for large-scale applications, including biomass, solar photocatalytic, pyrolysis hydrogen production, and other technologies <ref type="bibr" coords="7,111.48,546.03,18.43,11.62" target="#b36">[38]</ref>. In contrast, the latter technology is relatively mature on an industrial scale, but there is a significant cost gap compared to traditional hydrogen production methods. The technology widely used for hydrogen production in energy system research is EC using wind and solar generation <ref type="bibr" coords="7,525.00,587.43,18.43,11.62" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</p><p>This technology can meet the demand for green hydrogen while smoothing out renewable energy fluctuations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hydrogen compression link</head><p>At normal temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a gas with a low volumetric energy density.</p><p>Therefore, it is generally compressed using various compression techniques to the appropriate state for storage, transportation, and application. Compression is closely linked to the storage and transportation links, and their basic technical classifications and forms of hydrogen energy flow are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,541.92,416.79,4.50,11.62" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.</p><p>Hydrogen compression technology can be classified into mechanical and non-mechanical compression methods based on the types of compressors used. Mechanical compression is commonly used in current energy systems to pressurize low-pressure hydrogen into a high-pressure gaseous state <ref type="bibr" coords="8,475.32,478.83,18.43,11.62" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. It has the advantages of low cost, low energy consumption, and mature technology. Non-mechanical compression methods include cryogenic liquefaction, metal hydride, and electrochemical compression. Compared with mechanical compression, non-mechanical compression offers greater compression efficiency and safety <ref type="bibr" coords="8,85.20,561.63,18.43,11.62" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. However, considering technical challenges and associated costs, the large-scale implementation of non-mechanical compression in energy systems is not yet feasible. To accurately characterize the role of hydrogen in energy systems, it is essential to consider hydrogen losses and compressor energy consumption during compression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Hydrogen storage link</head><p>The hydrogen storage link is an essential component of the HEC and serves as the basis for long-term energy storage and large-scale hydrogen transfer. Hydrogen can be stored in three material forms: gaseous, liquid, and solid. According to the theory, hydrogen storage technology can be divided into physical and chemical types. The former includes high-pressure gaseous, low-temperature liquid, and activated carbon adsorption hydrogen storage, while the latter involves metal hydrides and organic liquid hydride storage <ref type="bibr" coords="9,160.80,102.75,14.62,11.62" target="#b40">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,180.30,102.75,14.62,11.62" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. While low-temperature liquid hydrogen storage has the advantage of high energy density, ensuring its safety in terms of adiabatic requirements is difficult and expensive.</p><p>Furthermore, technical challenges such as excessive energy consumption during the liquefaction process still require resolution <ref type="bibr" coords="9,202.80,164.79,18.43,11.62" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. Solid hydrogen storage has a higher energy density than liquid hydrogen storage and has the advantages of high safety, low storage pressure, and high purity.</p><p>Therefore, it is widely regarded as the best method for hydrogen storage <ref type="bibr" coords="9,399.60,206.19,18.43,11.62" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. However, solid hydrogen storage is not yet available for large-scale applications because of technical difficulties and expensive cost constraints. Currently, the most widespread method applied in energy systems is high-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage. This method offers advantages such as fast charging/discharging speed, simple structure, and mature technology <ref type="bibr" coords="9,255.24,288.99,18.43,11.62" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. To improve the operational flexibility of the energy system, mobile hydrogen storage has been proposed since fixed hydrogen storage cannot transfer energy on a spatial scale <ref type="bibr" coords="9,169.32,330.39,18.43,11.62" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. Compared with traditional electrochemical energy storage, the long-term storage characteristics of hydrogen can effectively address the contradiction of the seasonal imbalance between renewable energy output and load demand <ref type="bibr" coords="9,311.16,371.79,12.78,11.62" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. It enables the optimal allocation of energy resources over time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Hydrogen transportation link</head><p>Hydrogen transportation serves as a bridge in the HEC, connecting isolated hydrogen production, storage, or application sites to achieve optimal allocation of hydrogen energy across space. The mode of transportation is usually closely related to the hydrogen form, distance, and scale. Common modes include gaseous hydrogen tube trailers, liquid hydrogen trucks, pipelines, ships, and railways <ref type="bibr" coords="9,508.92,702.99,14.62,11.62" target="#b46">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,528.42,702.99,14.62,11.62" target="#b47">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Liquid hydrogen trucks offer a cost-effective and high-capacity solution for long-distance transportation.</p><p>In addition, liquid hydrogen can be transported over long distances by ships and railways, although safety concerns regarding leakage must be considered <ref type="bibr" coords="10,322.92,102.75,18.43,11.62" target="#b48">[50]</ref>. Compared with liquid hydrogen trucks, solid hydrogen storage vehicles are considered safer and can be transported at normal temperatures and pressures. However, because of technical and cost constraints, only small-scale demonstration applications have been realized <ref type="bibr" coords="10,204.12,164.79,18.43,11.62" target="#b49">[51]</ref>. The main mode of large-scale hydrogen transportation over long distances is pipeline transportation of gaseous hydrogen, but the infrastructure is costly and has long construction periods. In the world, approximately 5,000 km of existing hydrogen pipelines and 1 million km of natural gas pipelines are in operation <ref type="bibr" coords="10,297.72,226.95,18.43,11.62" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. Therefore, blending hydrogen with natural gas to utilize existing pipeline infrastructure is considered a promising transition method to enable a lowcost, scaled, and continuous hydrogen energy supply. The gaseous hydrogen tube trailer with a small single-vehicle capacity is a mature technology that is more economical for short distances <ref type="bibr" coords="10,509.88,288.99,18.43,11.62" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. In addition, unlike closed pipeline networks, gaseous tube trailers offer the flexibility to transport mobile hydrogen storage tanks (HSTs) from production and application sites <ref type="bibr" coords="10,384.12,330.39,18.43,11.62" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Hydrogen transportation can address the spatial imbalance between the hydrogen load and demand, contributing to the optimal allocation of energy resources across space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Hydrogen application link</head><p>Hydrogen application is the final stage of HEC. With various conversion and application scenarios, hydrogen will contribute to the deep decarbonization of chemical, industrial, energy, traffic, and other sectors in the future, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="10,230.28,458.07,4.50,11.62" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. In 2022, global hydrogen consumption reached 95 million tons, with 41 million tons used in petroleum refining and 53 million tons in synthetic ammonia, synthetic methane, and steel smelting <ref type="bibr" coords="10,195.72,499.47,18.43,11.62" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. At this stage, hydrogen is used mainly for chemical feedstock production, which accounts for approximately 99% of the total hydrogen consumption. While hydrogen consumption in traffic is currently negligible, it is projected to exceed 30% of the total energy consumption of traffic by 2050 <ref type="bibr" coords="10,203.76,561.51,18.43,11.62" target="#b51">[53]</ref>. Hydrogen can provide power for various modes of traffic sector, including road, rail, marine, and air transportation. The prevailing application scenarios are HFCVs with hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) <ref type="bibr" coords="10,246.72,602.91,18.43,11.62" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. FC technology can also be applied to energy systems for distributed generation or cogeneration, while HTs and hydrogen-fired boilers (HBs) can also be utilized for energy supply <ref type="bibr" coords="10,140.40,644.31,18.43,11.62" target="#b53">[55]</ref>. Moreover, hydrogen can react with CO2 captured by CCS to produce clean natural gas <ref type="bibr" coords="10,103.08,665.07,18.43,11.62" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. As a flexible and efficient energy carrier, hydrogen can realize the interconnection and complementarity of various energy forms, such as electric power, heat, and natural gas, through diverse application scenarios. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Relationships between the links of the HEC</head><p>The diverse links in the complete HEC are closely interrelated and interact with each other, and the fundamental composition is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,257.64,333.39,4.50,11.62" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. Hydrogen production is the starting point of HEC and is related to the operation of all subsequent links. It converts feedstocks such as fossil fuel, electricity, and water into hydrogen. Compression is necessary to meet the requirements of storage and transportation links and directly affects storage efficiency. The hydrogen storage link enables hydrogen transfer over time, and its technology choice determines the mode of hydrogen transportation. For example, pipelines or tube trailers are generally chosen for gaseous storage, while liquid hydrogen trucks or ships are used for liquid storage. The production and application links determine the charging or discharging of the HS.</p><p>Transportation link connects remote terminals to achieve link synergy and hydrogen transfer across space. The application link is the end point of the HEC. The other links synergize to meet the hydrogen demand of the application end.

Moreover, research</p><p>shows that HSTs are the most commonly used hydrogen storage technology. They are usually coupled with ECs to realize on-site storage and further enhance the energy system flexibility. Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="18,528.00,102.75,20.08,11.62" target="#b96">[98]</ref> considered low-and high-pressure HSTs to meet the hydrogen pressure requirements for FC and hydrogen loads, respectively. Reference <ref type="bibr" coords="18,246.36,144.15,20.08,11.62" target="#b64">[66]</ref> considered the uncertainty of wind energy and hydrogen demand for hydrogen infrastructure planning. The simulation results show that the investment cost of the storage battery is much greater than the obtainable benefits. Therefore, only investing in HSTs for a wind fluctuation regulation policy can reduce the total investment cost. Soheil Mohseni et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="18,528.00,206.19,20.08,11.62" target="#b92">[94]</ref> conducted a validation analysis of the financial viability of HSTs. Although it is less expensive to utilize lead-acid and lithium batteries instead of HSTs for planning, both types of energy storage are environmentally harmful. Considering the cost of environmental treatment, the total cost will be greater than that of the HST planning scenario. In addition, the application of HSTs avoids the idling of ECs when the hydrogen load is zero, allowing for maximum utilization of the ECs' potential.</p><p>Researchers utilize HSTs in energy systems for short-term and seasonal HS research. The difference in parameters between them is mainly in the cost. For instance, in the literature <ref type="bibr" coords="18,433.20,351.15,18.43,11.62" target="#b59">[61]</ref>, the short-term and seasonal HST costs are $15/kWh and $0.91/kWh, with a difference of more than ten times. In addition, short-term HSTs are regulated by charging and discharging hydrogen within a day, whereas seasonal HSTs are regulated between days with lower charge cycles per year. Guangsheng Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="18,528.00,413.19,19.96,11.62" target="#b79">[81]</ref> conducted a collaborative planning analysis of HSTs across different time scales. This paper sets the state of charge of the short-term HST to be the same at 0:00 and 24:00, with only one operation state (charge/discharge) in the seasonal HST each day. The challenge in modeling seasonal HSTs is to simplify the complexity of planning on long-time scales while simulating the variation in hydrogen stored between seasons. Conventional planning methods based on typical days with time discontinuities cannot simulate seasonal hydrogen storage. To address this issue, literature <ref type="bibr" coords="18,414.84,537.39,20.08,11.62" target="#b60">[62]</ref> proposed a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) planning method based on the characteristics of different devices in the energy system. This approach can reduce problem complexity while realizing hourly highresolution long-term planning.</p><p>In HEC-MES, hydrogen can also be stored in underground geologic formations such as depleted oil fields, aquifers, and salt caverns (SCs). SCs are considered the most suitable underground storage media for HS because of their gas tightness and lack of reaction with hydrogen <ref type="bibr" coords="18,450.60,661.59,24.20,11.62" target="#b130">[132]</ref>. Compared to HSTs, SCs also have the advantages of a small footprint aboveground, low price, and high safety <ref type="bibr" coords="18,519.00,682.23,24.20,11.62" target="#b131">[133]</ref>.</p><p>Study <ref type="bibr" coords="18,81.24,702.99,19.96,11.62" target="#b20">[22]</ref> analyzed the impact of SC costs on an energy system using the example of a future European zero-carbon emission power system. The article argued that the lower the SC costs, the better the energy system meets the demand for flexibility and large-scale energy storage. In addition, the availability of SCs becomes an important internal driver for the storage scale, taking into account natural constraints. For example, reference <ref type="bibr" coords="19,255.96,123.39,26.08,11.62" target="#b111">[113]</ref> chose Anhui Province as a research case because of its abundant SC resources. Hydrogen stored in SCs is typically used for seasonal storage in energy systems to regulate the imbalance between energy supply and demand over time. Vincent Oldenbroek et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="19,528.00,164.79,19.96,11.62" target="#b73">[75]</ref> examined the seasonal variation in hydrogen storage in an SC. Owing to the summer concentration of PV, the seasonal renewable energy output and the load curve are more mismatched as the PV proportion increases. A lower match results in a more significant regulation effect of SCs on the energy system, requiring more new installed capacity.</p><p>In HEC-MES planning, several articles consider multiple energy storage methods. For instance, literature <ref type="bibr" coords="19,94.80,288.99,20.08,11.62" target="#b95">[97]</ref> conducted synergistic planning of hydrogen, electricity, heat, and cold storage devices.</p><p>The optimal allocation for multiple energy storage is crucial for coordinating heterogeneous energy flexibility and smoothing renewable energy volatility. It has many benefits, including compensating for power imbalances on multi-time scales <ref type="bibr" coords="19,238.80,351.15,20.08,11.62" target="#b88">[90]</ref> and reducing system investment costs <ref type="bibr" coords="19,447.60,351.15,18.43,11.62" target="#b80">[82]</ref>. In addition, HS also plays a role in HEC-MES planning for cross-space energy transfer due to its mobility, which is detailed in the next section.</p></div>

Although this model type is accurate, it is generally only used for refined modeling of small energy systems at the distribution network scale because of its non-convexity, computational complexity, and solution difficulty.

Other researchers have explored the synergistic expansion optimization of multi-energy networks, such as in literature <ref type="bibr" coords="28,276.96,435.03,20.08,11.62" target="#b75">[77]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="28,326.40,435.03,18.43,11.62" target="#b76">[78]</ref>, which expanded the electric-hydrogen network to promote the optimal allocation of heterogeneous energy in a complementary and cross-space manner.</p><p>Furthermore, the road transportation of hydrogen is dependent on traffic networks. Therefore, collaborative multi-network planning for electricity, hydrogen, and traffic is essential for coordinating the flow of electricity and hydrogen energy and traffic. Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="28,377.64,538.59,20.08,11.62" target="#b77">[79]</ref> coupled electricity, hydrogen, and transportation networks through ECs and hydrogen-fueled vehicles. It explored the synergies of multiple networks to optimize the flexibility and economy of the energy system. Yuanzheng Li et al.</p><p>[84] established a multi-network planning structure considering the coupling constraints of power flow in an electric network, mass flow in a hydrogen network, and traffic flow in a traffic network to plan energy supply facilities. The results demonstrate that the structure effectively optimizes the cost, renewable energy utilization, voltage deviation, and transmission loss performance while ensuring the safety of the electric-hydrogen network.</p><p>As more sectors and energy network expansions are introduced, the complexity and solving difficulty of the model increase. All sector coupling and multi-network expansion have not been considered simultaneously in every HEC-MES planning study we reviewed. Addressing the challenge of reconciling the fineness of multi-sector coupling with the model's complexity is necessary for future HEC-MES planning studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Time scope</head><p>Temporally, planning studies for HEC-MES that consider seasonal hydrogen storage typically use the year as the time scale, with a resolution of monthly, daily, and hourly intervals. Annual resolution is commonly used to study transition paths and guidelines for large-scale energy system transitions <ref type="bibr" coords="29,519.00,275.19,24.20,11.62" target="#b107">[109]</ref>.</p><p>For example, literature <ref type="bibr" coords="29,161.04,295.95,20.08,11.62" target="#b86">[88]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="29,205.08,295.95,20.08,11.62" target="#b93">[95]</ref> proposed a multi-year planning analysis with an annual resolution to analyze the inter-annual installed capacity changes during the energy system transition process.</p><p>However, the magnitude and complexity of the planning problem increases with increasing time scale.</p><p>Therefore, long-term planning with hourly resolution suffers from the difficult and time-consuming nature of solving this problem. The most common simplification is planning based on typical days derived from historical data <ref type="bibr" coords="29,185.16,399.39,19.02,11.62" target="#b79">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="29,204.18,399.39,14.26,11.62" target="#b89">91]</ref>. HEC-MES planning is often divided into 4 typical days by season <ref type="bibr" coords="29,47.40,420.15,19.96,11.62" target="#b55">[57]</ref> or 12 typical days by month <ref type="bibr" coords="29,209.76,420.15,18.43,11.62" target="#b59">[61]</ref>. Because of their unique and discrete typical days, these methods fail to simulate medium-and long-term storage properties precisely. Paolo Gabrielli et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,480.84,440.79,20.08,11.62" target="#b60">[62]</ref> proposed two MILP models that distinguish different decision variable types. These simplify the integer decision variables for equipment based on typical days, while other decision variables maintain hourly accuracy throughout the year. The above methods are applied in the literature <ref type="bibr" coords="29,384.00,502.95,19.96,11.62" target="#b57">[59]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="29,428.64,502.95,18.43,11.62" target="#b58">[60]</ref>, which validate that they can effectively reduce model complexity and computation.</p></div>

Based on the presence or absence of a transmission network, we categorize HEC-MES into single-node systems without a network and interconnected multi-node systems. Most studies focus on the former without considering any transmission network expansion or energy interaction and ignore the geographic configuration and renewable energy endowment impacts of equipment planning. There is also some literature focusing on small-scale islanded energy systems with self-sufficiency, such as residential buildings <ref type="bibr" coords="29,491.04,692.55,24.20,11.62" target="#b115">[117]</ref>, rural areas <ref type="bibr" coords="29,76.08,713.31,24.20,11.62" target="#b119">[121]</ref>, and ships <ref type="bibr" coords="29,159.36,713.31,24.20,11.62" target="#b138">[140]</ref>. Reference <ref type="bibr" coords="29,245.28,713.31,26.08,11.62" target="#b123">[125]</ref> designed islanded hybrid renewable energy systems for residential buildings with ECs, FCs, and HSTs. Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="29,337.92,733.95,26.08,11.62" target="#b100">[102]</ref> proposed various topologies for PV-based microgrids for residential buildings and analyzed the optimal capacity configuration for both grid-connected and islanded states. The results show that the islanded mode is more expensive but improves reliability, autonomy, and energy efficiency and achieves zero-carbon emissions. Both the resource distribution <ref type="bibr" coords="30,150.72,144.15,20.08,11.62" target="#b73">[75]</ref> and load density <ref type="bibr" coords="30,258.24,144.15,26.08,11.62" target="#b106">[108]</ref> vary between regions. Researchers usually simplify a district into a single node to reduce complexity. For example, literature <ref type="bibr" coords="30,391.92,164.79,20.08,11.62" target="#b75">[77]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="30,435.24,164.79,26.08,11.62" target="#b107">[109]</ref> divided Germany and Italy into multi-node systems by region, respectively. For multi-node systems, the degree of refinement of the transmission network model relates to the size of its spatial extent. Smaller lowvoltage energy systems usually consider detailed flow models, which are generally categorized as either direct current flow <ref type="bibr" coords="30,141.00,247.59,19.96,11.62" target="#b76">[78]</ref> or alternating current flow <ref type="bibr" coords="30,295.44,247.59,18.43,11.62" target="#b91">[93]</ref>. The latter considers active and reactive power, making its planning results more in line with reality. Correspondingly, the problem becomes more complex and usually requires convexification and linearization operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">General relationship between the planning model and different resolutions</head><p>Temporal and spatial resolution contributes to the complexity and solution difficulty of the planning model and the accuracy of the results. Literature <ref type="bibr" coords="30,305.76,354.51,20.08,11.62" target="#b86">[88]</ref> modeled the level of spatial resolution by different numbers of nodes. Comparing the 30-and 43-node scenarios, there is less than 1% error in the planning results and a 30% reduction in the solution time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Uncertainty</head><p>With the enhancing coupling of multiple energy sources and high penetration of renewable energy access, complex and diverse uncertainties can significantly influence HEC-MES planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Uncertainty source</head><p>The research statistics of uncertain sources are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="30,377.04,547.71,10.00,11.62" target="#fig_13">13</ref>. In the reviewed literature, the uncertainties can be categorized into four main types by source: contextual parameters, technical parameters, power, and load. Uncertainty in contextual parameters can be divided into policy context and environmental context. The former usually includes electricity and gas prices, feed-in tariffs, and carbon taxes <ref type="bibr" coords="30,110.88,630.51,18.43,11.62" target="#b57">[59]</ref>.

The uncertainty of meteorological data mentioned above can directly affect renewable energy output.

This type of uncertainty requires a high degree of system flexibility and usually results in the redundant capacity of flexible resources such as ECs and HSs. Uncertainty exists for many load forms, such as electricity, heat, cold, and hydrogen, especially for flexible and adjustable loads such as HVs <ref type="bibr" coords="31,140.64,102.75,19.02,11.62" target="#b59">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="31,159.66,102.75,14.26,11.62" target="#b95">97]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Formulation form</head><p>As mentioned previously, HEC-MES involves tightly coupled sectors, multiple energy devices, and especially hydrogen energy devices with complex dynamic characteristics. For instance, ECs have nonlinear efficiency profiles <ref type="bibr" coords="33,174.60,651.27,18.43,11.62" target="#b72">[74]</ref>. Moreover, the number of devices <ref type="bibr" coords="33,375.72,651.27,20.08,11.62" target="#b89">[91]</ref> and operational state changes inevitably introduce integer variables, such as the start/stop states of ECs <ref type="bibr" coords="33,402.96,671.91,20.08,11.62" target="#b65">[67]</ref> and charging/discharging states of HSTs <ref type="bibr" coords="33,120.84,692.55,18.43,11.62" target="#b58">[60]</ref>. The planning problem for HEC-MES is characterized by high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and non-convexity. Its formulation is a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model with high accuracy but is computationally intensive and difficult to solve. Therefore, many studies simplify it to a MILP model using convexification and linearization.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and future directions</head><p>With the further increase in renewable energy penetration, large-scale clean hydrogen production using WTs and PVs becomes possible and contributes to hydrogen energy development in the energy system. As a medium converted with multiple energy sources, HEC can realize the optimal allocation of heterogeneous energy sources across time and space. It can also boost the deep decarbonization of the energy system. However, HEC involves numerous devices and technologies, so there is an urgent requirement for rational and efficient planning methods to realize the deep integration of HEC with MESs. By focusing on the coupling of hydrogen energy with the energy sector, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the planning research of HEC-MES. On the one hand, we introduce the concept of the HEC with each link and outline the status of planning for key hydrogen energy technologies in energy systems in recent years. On the other hand, we also systematically review the modeling features and methods of the HEC-MES planning problem, analyzing the involved sectors, spatial and temporal scopes, uncertainties, model formulations, and solution methods in depth.</p><p>Through a review of related literature, we summarize the gaps in the current research on HEC-MES planning and the directions that deserve to be explored in depth in future research, mainly as follows:</p><p>(1) Current research focuses on single or several hydrogen energy links, and few studies consider the complete HEC with all links, limiting the deep integration of hydrogen energy with MESs. In HEC-MES, the interactions between the various links of the HEC and their impact on planning are worth exploring;</p><p>(2) There are various types of hydrogen energy equipment and technologies, and most of the studies only consider a single equipment and technology for a particular link in the HEC while planning. The portfolio selection of HEC equipment that combines technical efficiency, flexibility, and economy still requires further research;</p><p>(3) Current studies have verified the advantages of multi-sectoral collaboration. However, the mechanism of cross-sectoral collaboration still needs to be investigated, and no study has yet comprehensively considered multi-energy coupling, multi-network, and multiple energy storage in a well-rounded manner. The effect of non-energy sectors such as HFCVs and green hydrogen chemicals in energy system planning is also an important direction for future research;</p><p>(4) Most current studies consider only one or two types of uncertainty and ignore the impact of N-1 fault uncertainty on planning security. Modeling methods incorporating information technologies such as deep learning and distributed robust optimization remain to be thoroughly investigated;</p><p>(5) A refined HEC model is established to accurately describe the synergies between various devices in each link to rationally and efficiently optimize the capacity allocation. An urgent challenge for future research is to find suitable optimization algorithms that effectively address the contradiction between model refinement and solution difficulty.</p><p>This review focuses on the synergistic planning study of MESs containing hydrogen energy chain, aiming to provide a reference for the promotion of top-down hydrogen energy chain applications and for exploring the shape of future low-carbon energy systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1" coords="3,145.44,410.61,304.33,10.33;3,70.92,244.32,453.48,156.48"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
